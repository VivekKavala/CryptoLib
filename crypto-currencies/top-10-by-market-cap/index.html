                <p class="small-txt">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong> is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created
                    in
                    2009 by an anonymous entity known as <em>Satoshi Nakamoto</em>. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized
                    peer-to-peer network, allowing users to send and receive payments without the need for
                    intermediaries
                    like banks. As a pioneer of blockchain technology, Bitcoin has set the standard for digital
                    currencies.
                </p>

                <p class="small-txt">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;With a finite supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often compared to gold due to its
                    scarcity and store of value properties. Over the years, Bitcoin has grown in popularity as both an
                    investment asset and a medium of exchange. It is now widely accepted by various merchants,
                    institutions,
                    and even governments.

                <ul class="small-txt">
                    <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Bitcoin runs on a global network of computers (nodes),
                        ensuring
                        no central authority controls it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Supply</strong>: There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, driving scarcity
                        and
                        demand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded on an
                        immutable public ledger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security</strong>: Bitcoin uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, making
                        it
                        highly resistant to fraud.</li>

                <h3 class="small-txt">Why Bitcoin is Important</h3>
                <p class="small-txt">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin is not just a digital currency but a financial revolution. It introduced the
                    concept
                    of decentralized finance, offering users freedom from traditional banking systems and centralized
                    control. Bitcoin has become a symbol of economic freedom, and its underlying blockchain technology
                    has
                    paved the way for innovation across multiple industries.

                    Its
                    native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to facilitate transactions and power smart contracts

                    of
                    the US dollar. Launched in 2014, Tether offers the benefits of cryptocurrency, such as fast,
                    borderless
                    transactions, while minimizing volatility by maintaining a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar. Each Tether
                    token is backed by reserves, which are held to match the circulating supply of USDT.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong> is a third-generation cryptocurrency platform founded by
                    Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Launched in 2017, Cardano aims to create a more secure
                    and scalable blockchain ecosystem through a research-driven approach and peer-reviewed development.
                    Unlike many cryptocurrencies, Cardano emphasizes a layered architecture that separates the
                    settlement layer from the computation layer, enhancing flexibility and security.

                    called Ouroboros, which is designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional proof-of-work
                    systems. This approach allows ADA holders to participate in the network’s security while earning
                    rewards through staking.
