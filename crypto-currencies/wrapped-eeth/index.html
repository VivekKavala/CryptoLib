                &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is a decentralized digital currency, abbreviated as BTC. In
                the decentralized bitcoin
                peer-to-peer network, transactions are cryptographically verified and recorded in a public distributed
                ledger called a blockchain, with no central supervision. Nodes reach consensus through an
                energy-consuming, computationally intensive process dubbed mining, underpinned by proof of work securing
                the bitcoin blockchain. Mining is energy-intensive and thus has been criticized for the environmental
                impact it causes. <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It
                was
                introduced as a medium of exchange in 2009 after the publication of its open source implementation. In
                2021, it was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador. Created initially as a means of payment, today it
                is more considered a store of value and an investment; many consider it an economic bubble. This has
                attracted regulatory attention due to this pseudonymous nature, and its use by criminals has many
                countries banning it.

                        A person or group of people, unknown to this day, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto posts
                        a whitepaper entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." It described a way to

                        a
                        decentralized digital currency whose central server would have been based on cryptographic

                        Bitcoin was used by a few early adopters, developers only. Its value was near

                        it was viewed more as an experiment.

                            Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and has established a strong brand and significant
                            network effects. Its name recognition and adoption provide it with a significant advantage

                            Bitcoin�s network can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. This can lead

                            Bitcoin mining requires significant computational power, leading to high energy consumption
                            and environmental concerns. This has raised criticisms about its sustainability and carbon

                            Bitcoin�s price is highly volatile, which can pose risks for investors and users. This
                            volatility can make it difficult to use Bitcoin as a stable store of value or medium of
