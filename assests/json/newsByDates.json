            "title": "FBI warns users of fake cryptocurrency platform ICHCoin and believes there's more victims",
            "description": "HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The FBI is looking to identify additional victims of a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform that has taken millions of dollars from people across the U.S. FBI Houston's Assistant Special Agent in Charge Amanda Culver called ICHCoin both a \"scheme\" and a \"scam.\" She said it starts with someone reaching out to the victims on social media, including Instagram or Facebook, and asking if the recipient wants to learn more about investing in cryptocurrency. She said the profiles reaching out are fake. The victims are then directed to WhatsApp to communicate with individuals claiming to teach them. From there, Culver said that people are urged to lie to their banks about the large wire transfer from the account to ICHCoin. According to the FBI, the victims can track the return on their investments on an ICHCoin app, but ultimately, there is no return on the investment. Culver said when the victims try to collect their money from the platform, they are ghosted and cannot get their money back. Throughout the investigation, the FBI found people who had lost their entire life savings on the fraudulent platform. \"The average person could certainly be fooled by this scam,\" Culver said. ABC13 asked Culver if the person or persons behind it were in the U.S. or abroad, and she said they were working to find out. \"I think it's important for people to know that any time you receive unsolicited messages from people asking you to invest, promising high rates of return on your investment, telling you that they're going to give you free money for you to invest, anything along those lines, those are red flags,\" Culver explained. \"We want to make sure the word is out there that these fake platforms exist.\" Since December 2023, the FBI has found that approximately $30 million in the U.S. has been lost to the platform. \"It is extremely easy to use these platforms to bamboozle people,\" Culver said. \"It's a whole new world for folks. People are very interested in investing in cryptocurrency, and crypto is one of those platforms on which folks recognize that there can be a return on investment. The concern is that homework needs to be done.\" They have already identified victims of ICHCoin in Houston but are looking to hear more from them. Anyone who believes they have fallen victim can answer the questionnaire on the FBI's website. For more on this story, follow Mycah Hatfield on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

            "description": "If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might\u2019ve seen a banner featuring a ton of gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website taken over hackers to .\n\nAccording to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4, on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring \u201cOur new LEGO Coin is officially out!\u201d Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven\u2019t been any other attempts to bring back the banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you\u2019re worried about that, Engadget confirmed clicking that banner\u2019s \u201cbuy now\u201d link takes you to the collection.\n\nHow did this happen? LEGO isn\u2019t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been \u201cswiftly resolved.\u201d More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during this time, and that customers \u201ccan continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.\u201d\n\nDespite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure you\u2019re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.\n\nWant more io9 news?

            "description": "Kamala Harris has seen her betting odds shrink over Donald Trump to a razor-thin margin with less than a month to go before November\u2019s election.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s lead over the former president has significantly narrowed to a single point as bets surge in favor of Trump, according to the Election Betting Odds tracker.\n\nBookmakers now give Harris a 50.1 percent chance of winning the race for the White House, while Trump is close behind on 49.1 percent. \n\nLast week, Harris was leading by 3.5 points.\n\nThe tracker works by consolidating betting numbers from five major markets \u2013 Betfair, Smarkets, PredictIt, Polymarket, and Kalshi.\n\nOut of the five bookies, crypto-based betting platform Polymarket has given Trump\u2019s odds of winning a boost, predicting he is now the slight favorite at 51.1 percent to Harris\u2019s 48.3 percent.\n\nThe platform has also increased Trump\u2019s odds of winning the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. Bookmakers give him a 55.5 percent chance of victory in the state compared to a 49 percent chance last week.\n\nOther bookmakers give Harris a slight lead over Trump. On Kalshi, bookies put Harris ahead at 51 percent compared to Trump\u2019s 49 percent. On PredictIt, the VP has 54 cents per share, which roughly equates to a 54 percent chance of winning, compared to 50 cents per share for Trump.\n\nAnd, the British betting site Smarkets predicts Harris has a 50.5 percent chance of taking the White House compared to Trump, whose odds are 48 percent.\n\nThe polls, meanwhile, are incredibly close. The vice president currently has a 2.7-point lead over Trump in the latest average of national polls, collated by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nOn average, Harris has been marginally ahead of Trump in national polls for several weeks. In the key battleground states, the polls are almost neck-and-neck. \n\nHarris is ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania \u2013 but only just, according to the New York Times. Trump, meanwhile, has narrow leads in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.\n\nIn better news for Harris, Trump\u2019s lead in his home state of Florida has dwindled, putting it in play for the vice president, a poll suggests.\n\nThe former president now leads Harris by just two percentage points in the Sunshine State, home to his Mar-a-Lago residence, according to a Thursday survey by Napolitan News Service conducted by RMG Research, which has historically favored Republicans.\n\nThere appears to be a stark age divide in the poll\u2019s findings. While Harris has a stark lead among young Floridians, with 55 per cent of those polled supporting the Democratic presidential nominee to just 43 per cent supporting Trump, the former president leads significantly with the older crowd. \n\nMore than half (53 per cent) of those aged 65 and older expressed backing Trump compared to 44 percent backing Harris.",

            "title": "The Worst Return From Holding Bitcoin",
            "description": "Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPerson Holding Silver Bitcoin Coin\nCrypto Crow via Pexels\n\nHow long do you need to hold Bitcoin to beat the market, regardless of when you bought or sold?\n\nMichael Saylor once claimed that you should never hold Bitcoin for less than four years because you are guaranteed to not lose money. The idea is that if you are holding a highly appreciating asset like Bitcoin, what really matters is the holding period rather than the specifics of when you bought or sold. If the asset appreciates enough, that appreciation will swamp the details of what specific price you bought or sold and, therefore, erase some of the stress from the volatility.\n\nLet's evaluate this claim against Bitcoin price data. First, I'm going to generalize the conjecture to be: \u201cIf you hold Bitcoin for time x, you will be guaranteed to earn a return above y.\u201d Saylor took x = four years, and y = zero, but we can actually find what horizon gives the worst return on Bitcoin, and compare that to other investments, like the S&P500.\n\nThe Worst Case\n\nI'm going to use a trick from computer science called worst-case analysis. This is a method for evaluating algorithms when you don't necessarily have good information on uncertainty, and instead just want to ask how the algorithm would perform in a worst case. In this case, our \u201calgorithm\u201d is the return to holding Bitcoin, so we want to come up with a measure for the worst return from holding Bitcoin over different horizons. That is the lower bound on your return, since it will represent buying at the highest possible price and selling at the lowest possible price. This is your worst case.\n\nHere's my method. I use daily Bitcoin price data from January 2011 to January 2024. For a fixed holding period, I calculate the return over all possible buys and sells. For example, consider a two year holding period , and compute the 2 year return from buying on 1/1/2011 and selling 2 years later, buying on 1/2/2011 and selling 2 years later, buying on 1/3/2011 and selling 2 years later, etc. That will generate a different return for each possible 2 year holding period. Find the lowest of those returns \u2014- that\u2019s the worst possible 2 year return. (If you\u2019re curious, the worst 2 year return was -46% per year, with a buy on 12/4/2013 and sale at 12/4/2015). Now repeat this calculation for all possible holding periods (2 years, 2.1 years, 2.2 years, etc). With this in hand, you can now plot the worst return as a function of the horizon:\n\nValue of Scarcity\nPrinciplesofBitcoin.com\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nGmail Hackers Have Control Of 2FA, Email And Number? Here\u2019s What To Do\n\n\u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019 Hair Metal Night Scores\u2014Who Went Home In The Double Elimination?\n\nHurricane Milton Live Updates: Storm Hits Category 5 As It Heads Towards Florida\n\nHere are a few observations that are apparent. First, Bitcoin's volatility for short holding periods can lead to big losses, north of 75% of invested capital. That is the volatility that captures almost all attention in the financial press. What they don't realize is that volatility has both downside and upside. The upside appears on the right half of the graph, where Bitcoin's returns steadily increase, peaking at 150% per year if held for the full 13-year horizon, from January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2024.\n\nSecond, the graph is not monotonic. It does not steadily increase but has peaks and valleys. For example, Bitcoin's worst return crosses 0% first at 3.25 years, again at four and a half years, and finally at over five years. So after 5.09 years, no one would have lost money by investing in Bitcoin, since the worst return is a lower bound on their payoff. After 5.86 years, Bitcoin would return at least the stock market\u2019s historical return of 8%. After 6.08 years, Bitcoin would return at least Warren Buffett's historical return of around 22%. And after a little more than 10 years, Bitcoin will have returned more than 50% annually, greater than nearly all other investments.\n\nNow let\u2019s compare Bitcoin against other assets:\n\nBitcoin vs. Other Assets\nPrinciplesofBitcoin.com\n\nWhile the worst return from holding the S&P 500 is positive after around three years, it never really takes off. You can see the greater volatility of Bitcoin, but also the higher returns. SPY\nPrincipal Shareholder Yield Index ETF\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\nlooks very safe in comparison, but that safety comes at a price.\n\nThis graph shows the volatility of Bitcoin in a new light. The worst returns from other assets like gold, real estate, and bonds are (a) similar to each other, and (b) nearly flat compared to Bitcoin. It's true that other assets may not lead to large initial losses, but they also do not lead to longer-term gains. By way of comparison, the worst return from the S&P 500 exceeds 0% after 3.61 years, and 8% after 9.85 years. Similarly, it takes gold 12.38 years to escape breakeven in its worst case. This graph also gives the best indication that Bitcoin really is a new kind of investment. Notice how stocks, bonds, and real estate cluster together, while Bitcoin is markedly different.\n\nWhat about a basket of tech stocks? Here are the worst returns of Bitcoin against those of Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia from January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2024:\n\nBitcoin vs. Big Tech\nPrinciplesofBitcoin.com\n\nCompared to the previous chart, the top tech stocks look more like Bitcoin, with larger losses for small holding periods and bigger gains for longer holding periods. It takes 4.23 years for Apple to guarantee a return of 0% and 6.83 years to exceed a return of 8%. It takes Tesla 5.71 years exceed break even, and it takes 6.21 years for Tesla to beat the historical stock market return of 8%.\n\nFinally, here is Bitcoin against 9 large companies\n\nBitcoin vs. Top Stocks\nPrinciplesofBitcoin.com\n\nEven if you had bought Bitcoin at the highest possible price and sold it at the lowest possible price, you would have eclipsed the worst return from all other stocks after year 10.\n\nThe Value of Scarcity\n\nThe graphs illustrate the value of scarcity. A bare economic logic governs the price of Bitcoin: the supply is fixed and predictable, while demand has increased. There is no other way for price to respond but to go up.\n\nYou may think, however, that all of this rests on social consensus: people want Bitcoin because they believe it to be valuable. That is true, but there is an important feedback loop here. The fixed supply is what makes it valuable, which in turn drives price up, which then attracts new buyers, which in turn increases demand, which then causes price to increase again, and so on. The fixed supply is existential for this feedback loop to occur. And that fixed supply is what is missing from all other investments, such as fiat currencies, gold, and real estate. So we may not have exactly returns of this same magnitude in the future, I cannot believe that the underlying forces at play will simply vanish altogether.\n\nThe analysis here is a snippet of a longer research paper on worst-case analysis that I'm writing for an academic audience. Bitcoin motivated this problem, but a worst-case metric can apply to any investment. All the data in the analysis above comes from publicly available resources, such as SPY for the S&P 500 and ETFs like GLD\nSPDR Gold Shares\nfor tracking the return from gold. This is part of a longer project for worst-case returns.

            "title": "Musk's Promised Robotaxi Unveil Delayed",
            "description": "Tesla fans were kept waiting on Thursday for the unveiling of Elon Musk's robotaxi, years after the brash billionaire first promised a car that could drive itself.The company's CEO is a master showman, whose ability to generate hype has helped make Tesla the world's best selling EV and propelled the firm's share price sky high, making him the richest man on the planet in the process.And he's currently employing those talents in the service of Republican Donald Trump, echoing the billionaire presidential candidate's dire warnings about migrants and a crumbling America, including during an exuberant appearance at a weekend Trump rally that was widely mocked.Little is known about what to expect at Thursday's unveiling at an event dubbed \"We, Robot\" (a play on Isaac Asimov's sci-fi classic 'I, Robot') that will take place at the Warner Brothers studio lot near Los Angeles.But more than 40 minutes after it was supposed to start, tens of thousands of people waiting to see the livestream were left watching the product of a graphics generator.Various crypto scams were stepping into the breach on YouTube, with AI-generated Musks urging viewers to send their Bitcoins for supposed huge profits.Musk told users on X -- the platform formerly known as Twitter -- that event staff were dealing with an emergency.\"A person in the crowd had a medical emergency. We have taken care of them and will be starting shortly,\" he wrote.The launch will be closely watched -- both by the boosters who are convinced he is a visionary changing the world, and by the skeptics who increasingly see an emperor with threadbare clothes.\"We believe wide-scale Tesla robotaxi deployment is unlikely within the coming years,\" said a note from UBS last month.\"That is not to say Tesla isn't making technological progress, but Tesla needs to show that the tech is ready and safe, deal with a myriad of local regulations and (potentially) figure out logistics and operations of a transportation network company.\"On the bullish side, analysts Wedbush predicted Thursday's event will be a \"seminal and historical day\" for Tesla, ushering in a new chapter of growth for autonomous technology.If Tesla successfully shows off a taxi that can drive itself, it won't be the first.Other companies, such as Google's Waymo and General Motors Cruise, have operated heavily regulated pilot programs for a few years already.But, says Musk, with characteristic bravura, his will be the best.The South African-born entrepreneur pushed back the date of the event, which was originally planned for August, \"to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,\" he said in July.He shrugged off regulatory questions about a technology venture that has so far only been demonstrated on a limited terrain and remains unseen by most of the general public.\"Once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human, we find that regulators are supportive of deployment of that capability,\" he said at the time.Forget that he said in 2016 a fully automated car was two years away, or that a year later he was touting a vehicle by 2019 so clever that customers would be able to sleep while it drove them around.As many car makers have found, self-driving is tricky.While lots of cars nowadays have limited automation, theoretically allowing the driver to cede some of the boring bits of driving to an onboard computer, the person behind the wheel still has to pay attention and jump in if the car does something unpredictable.That's because computers, unlike people, are not very good at reacting to unexpected events or situations they have never seen before, so self-driving vehicles have a history of doing things that a human would never do.The driver is in any case legally liable for what the car does. Tesla is facing a number of lawsuits stemming from deadly crashes in which drivers may have believed they were safe in the hands of the car's computer.It's in this context that some industry watchers are taking Thursday's expected announcements with a pinch of salt.\"It seems likely that we'll see a cool demo of a stylish-looking prototype, allowing Musk to claim a kind of victory for first impressions, even when the rough outlines of what he promises will barely hold up to scrutiny,\" wrote Andrew Hawkins of tech outlet The Verge.\"The exaltations from bullish investors will give him enough cover to continue to make misleading declarations about what is and isn't autonomous. \"And the safety experts and competitors who try to warn about the dangers of his approach will likely be drowned out or dismissed by his most ardent fans.\"",

            "description": "Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nForbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014with many more backing Harris\u2014but unlike the world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump\u2019s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nTrump and Harris during their September presidential debate.\nIllustration by Forbes; Photos by Win McNamee/Getty Images; Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOur breakdown records 76 billionaires supporting Harris and 49 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below).\n\nMany more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won\u2019t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December.\n\nBillionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires\u2014but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris.\n\nA letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris \u201cwill continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,\u201d indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors\u2014which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris\u2019s favor\u2014identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor.\n\nForbes will update this list through Election Day.\n\nJeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016.\nGetty Images\n\nBig-Time Billionaires Who Haven\u2019t Endorsed A Candidate:\n\nJeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world\u2019s fourth-richest man wrote Trump \u201cshowed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire\u201d following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden\u2019s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated \u201cunity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he\u2019s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world\u2019s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can\u2019t \u201cvote for a Democrat in this election\u201d after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is \u201cnot endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.\u201d In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump\u2019s response to the assassination attempt \u201cbadass\u201d in a July interview.\n\nBill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris\u2019 deepest backers\u2014her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle\u2014the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is \u201cgreat to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.\u201d But \u201cI don\u2019t tell other people how to vote\u201d due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added.\n\nJamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post last week touting Dimon\u2019s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon\u2019s words. He\u2019s been outspoken about the election, penning an editorial in the Washington Post calling on voters \u201cto elect a \u201cpresident who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.\u201d\n\nRay Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it\u2019s the \u201cmost consequential\u201d election of his, but he won\u2019t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate.\n\nSergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump\u2019s election \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle.\n\nLarry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he\u2019s \u201ctorn\u201d and won\u2019t vote with a \u201csmile on my face\u201d as both candidates aren\u2019t \u201cgoing to receive an award for the quality of their policies\u201d or \u201cthe quality of their leadership.\u201d Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter.\n\nWhich Billionaires Are Supporting Harris?\n\nA total of 76 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris.
