    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    {'offset': 0, 'number': 20, 'available': 1933, 'news': [{'id': 254722722, 'title': 'Trump Claims He’s Adding a Crypto Platform to the Family Business Empire', 'text': 'Former President Donald Trump on Thursday touted his family’s forthcoming crypto project, a platform called “The DeFiant Ones.” The name is a play on the crypto world’s shorthand term for decentralized finance. “For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” Trump wrote. “It’s time we take a stand—together. #BeDefiant” The post provided no other information about what The DeFiant Ones would actually do for its users, nor what it actually is. Though it seems likely to be a crypto-cooperative, a blockchain organizational structure otherwise known as a decentralized autonomous organization, it could just as easily be a coin, a marketplace, or even a blog of some kind. What the post did include was a link, which takes the user to a Telegram channel that boasted about 36,000 subscribers on Thursday night. The channel, which was created on Aug. 6, has a handful of posts teasing “the Trump DeFi project” and using the characteristically upbeat but empty parlance typically deployed by crypto aficionados. “Let’s go!!!!!” the channel posted with no further details last Sunday, its most recent dispatch as of Thursday. Trump’s endorsement follows weeks of hype-up by Eric and Don Jr. “Stay tuned for a big announcement…” Eric tweeted the same day the Telegram channel was created, gushing that he’d “truly fallen in love with Crypto / DeFi.” (Sorry, Lara.) Eric gave an interview to the New York Post the next week where he expanded on his love for crypto, touting it as the mark of “a world where we don’t have to play by the big bank’s playbook.” He suggested that the brothers’ project might target financially insecure Americans, ostensibly leveling the playing field by acting as a form of collateral. “Essentially over half this country right now cannot be banked,” Eric said. “Meaning they will be rejected for most loans from most institutions. But with this technology they could have the ability to almost instantaneously be approved or denied from a lender based on math, not policy. Money could be in their account in minutes, not months.” Tech blog The Verge pointed out after Trump’s announcement that crypto—a high-risk and volatile asset—can help unbanked and underserved communities more easily access financial services might not necessarily be true. In 2022, the Center for American Progress, a liberal economic policy institute, published an article noting that claims that crypto bolstered financial inclusion were “dubious” at best. “There is no systematic evidence that crypto transactions are less expensive than traditional financial transactions, and crypto assets are still primarily used for speculation instead of payments,” the article reads. “The fundamental purpose of financial inclusion is to improve the overall economic well-being of low-income individuals, and encouraging people to use their hard-earned paychecks or savings to buy highly risky assets could do just the opposite.” After spending years squinting suspiciously at crypto, Trump recently reversed course. As part of his presidential campaign, he appeared as the keynote speaker at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, and is openly being lobbied by cryptocurrency executives.', 'summary': 'Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday touted his family’s forthcoming crypto project, a platform called “The DeFiant Ones.” \n\nThe name is a play on the crypto world’s shorthand term for decentralized finance.\n\n“For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” Trump wrote. “It’s time we take a stand—together. #BeDefiant”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.', 'url': 'https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-claims-hes-adding-a-crypto-platform-to-the-family-business-empire', 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3714,w_6605,x_0,y_434/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1724369161/GettyImages-1928401539_j0cun5', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-08-23 00:02:55', 'author': 'Aj McDougall', 'authors': ['Aj McDougall'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'US', 'sentiment': -0.315}, {'id': 254723070, 'title': 'Philippine police raid Chinese-run scam centre', 'text': 'MANILA: Philippine police raided a Chinese-run scam centre in the capital Manila on Thursday (Aug 22), arresting dozens of Filipino and foreign workers who allegedly tricked people into investing in a "manipulated" trading platform. Police said the centre was operating in the guise of a licenced online gaming company, which President Ferdinand Marcos banned last month over the industry\'s links to scams, kidnapping, human trafficking and murder. Among the 67 foreigners arrested during the pre-dawn raid on an office tower in the metropolis were 58 Chinese nationals, plus people from Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam. There were also 32 Filipinos. The owner and manager of the facility – both Chinese nationals – were among those arrested, police said in a statement. Police said the centre was running a "crypto-currency investment scam" and "love scam", with employees posing as wealthy models who would "entice" victims to invest in a "manipulated" trading platform. The Filipinos arrested told police they were forced to work as scammers, the statement said, without specifying what would happen to them if they refused. Some employees worked as models who were made to "dress in a seductive manner" and engage in "lascivious conduct" to help lure prospective victims, the statement added.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/philippine-police-raid-chinese-run-scam-centre-president-ferdinand-marcos-manila-4562791', 'image': 'https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--F6XdDTNa--/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/07/25/philippines_scam_centre_office.jpg?itok=TA2Amsd_', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-08-23 00:28:03', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'catgory': 'politics', 'source_country': 'sg', 'sentiment': -0.093}, {'id': 254722964, 'title': 'Trump Claims He’s Adding a Crypto Platform to the Family Business Empire', 'text': "TCF vendors Exponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Privacy choices, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Probabilistic identifiersmoreCookie duration resets each session.

While more than €13.5m has been stolen from victims of investment fraud. This is compared to over €28m stolen from victims of investment fraud in Ireland last year, more than in 2021 and 2022 combined. An Garda Síochána is advising the public to pay close attention when considering any potential investments. Investment fraud is where criminals pose as investment managers to fool someone into investing money in schemes and projects that do not exist. "During a period of high cost of living, these sophisticated criminals are taking advantage by cloning webpages and targeting victims through online and social media adverts by promising ‘once in a lifetime opportunities’ to instantly invest with fast and large financial returns,” said gardaí. "Between January 2020 and August this year, over 1,117 people have reported incidents of investment fraud to A Garda Síochána. 44pc of the reported incidents made reference to ‘Bitcoin’ or ‘Crypto’. "Men are increasingly becoming the victim of the type of fraud and remain most at risk. “The majority of victims in the past four years have been male (64pc) and those aged over 40 make up over half of all victims.” Earlier this year a victim reported that she saw a post on social media advertising investment opportunities. The woman made contact with the company, whom she believed was legitimate, and during the course of their engagement she agreed to transfer €28,600 from her Revolut account to another. This crime is currently being investigated by An Garda Síochána. Another case includes a man coming forward to An Garda Síochána to report that he was the victim of an investment fraud after he came across a trading broker online. He initially invested €250 and after several more investments he noticed his equity rising rapidly. He was able to withdraw €5,000 and therefore believed that the company was legitimate. He continued to invest considerable size sums of money and within weeks had invested €250,000. The online trading broker disappeared and the victim has suffered a huge financial loss. Gardaí are investigating. A third case involved fraud advertised on a social media platform. After seeing an advert on a social media platform for an investment scheme, this victim reported that he had filled in his personal details and was contacted by purporting to be involved in the investment opportunity. After some discussion, the victim believed would be investing in trading through a mobile app and was enticed to send on €45,000. He was recently assured that he held over €727,000 return which was available in USD coin via an Ethereum wallet but when he checked he could not access it in an Atomic wallet. When he questioned this with his contact, the victim was told would need to pay €36,000 in DIRT tax to access to funds. It was then that he realised he may have invested in a fraudulent scheme and reported it to An Garda Síochána. Detective Superintendent Michael Cryan of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau said: "Investment fraud is on the rise and the schemes are more sophisticated than ever before. Sadly, those who become victims are ordinary, decent people that are having huge amounts of their life savings stolen from them be it their inheritance or a retirement lump sum. "The fraudsters involved in fraudulent investment schemes will sound convincing and claim to have insider knowledge but they are career criminals that are following a well-rehearsed script. It is crucially important that we are all mindful of who were are transferring money too and to be careful when sending via an international money transfer app to make sure it can be tracked. "Investment fraud can easily happen and no one is to be judged – we really encourage anyone who has been a victim in the past or who has more recently become a victim of investment fraud to please come forward and speak with us in any Garda Station.”', 'summary': 'Gardaí have warned the public over a “staggering” amount of money stolen through investment fraud so far this year.', 'url': 'https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gardai-warn-of-staggering-rise-in-investment-fraud-with-almost-half-of-reports-for-crypto-currency/a1064011735.html', 'image': 'https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/AECFuGQMH0C7nI1e-HCZCUtIRIs=/275x0:3249x1983/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/c5156ea2-21be-4ff2-b05e-f3ccfcd036e5/4aa5818f-24ba-4f1d-8ef4-ecb2e850ca17/c5156ea2-21be-4ff2-b05e-f3ccfcd036e5.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-08-23 01:30:00', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'ie', 'sentiment': -0.359}, {'id': 254735458, 'title': 'Crypto Gamers Shift to BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner – Outplaying Hamster Kombat and Sandbox in Style', 'text': 'Transparency and community involvement are now leading trends in the play-to-earn gaming sphere. While some initiatives face internal issues or lag behind, others progress with innovative features that reward participants. BlockDAG emerges as a promising option if you aim to optimize both time and financial opportunities in cryptocurrencies. Experts praise BlockDAG as a leading crypto miner of 2024, advising not to overlook it, even as Hamster Kombat and The Sandbox make headlines. The Troubles with Hamster Kombat Initially, Hamster Kombat was exciting until unexpected issues arose. The project has recently been plagued by internal disputes affecting its outcomes. A prominent investor, AD.RU, has openly criticized the leadership of Hamster Kombat, accusing them of not fulfilling their commitments. This conflict has escalated to potential legal actions, delaying the anticipated distribution of HMSTR coins. The Sandbox’s Ongoing Challenges The Sandbox (SAND) used to be a thriving blockchain game, but it has been struggling to keep pace recently. The price of SAND has stagnated below $0.35, a significant drop that disappoints its investors. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant increases, SAND has fallen by 37% since the year began. A temporary price increase on August 14th did little to improve its standing, quickly reversing any gains. BlockDAG TG Tap Miner Is Your Gateway to Substantial Rewards Leave the troubles and poor performance behind—BlockDAG ranks as a leading crypto miner for 2024, attracting wise crypto fans for solid reasons. You can earn BDAG coins with the BlockDAG TG Miner app, a play-to-earn platform that lets you mine on the move without needing elaborate equipment or deep tech knowledge. Yet, that’s only the start. The TG Miner app elevates the experience by giving rewards for mere taps on the screen. Picture this: an engaging, simple clicker game where each tap fills your pockets, not just your time. Every tap earns you Tap Points, which you can exchange for BDAG coins. The longer you play, the more you collect, rapidly increasing your earnings. It’s essentially like being paid to have fun—what’s not to love? BlockDAG goes beyond mere entertainment. With more than $67.4 million gathered in its presale and 12.7 billion coins distributed, it’s evident that many are heavily interested in this initiative. Although the current BDAG price of $0.0178 might look small, a 1680% rise has already been achieved, and the potential from here is vast. Some experts are forecasting that BDAG might soar to $1, offering substantial returns to those who join early. Why Choose BlockDAG as Your Top Crypto Miner While Hamster Kombat and The Sandbox have their merits, they come with their set of problems. In contrast, BlockDAG excels, combining enjoyment with lucrative opportunities through its pioneering apps and solid community support. For a crypto venture with promising growth prospects, consider BlockDAG as your primary choice.

The billionaire emailed Business Insider a few notes about what he likes about the nominee — healthcare transparency — and what he would like to see from Harris — more details about cryptocurrency — if he, as a business leader, was being pitched by the campaign.Harris met with corporate executives behind the scenes even months before she replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, The New York Times reported in July. Allies of her campaign have been privately courting business leaders during the Democratic National Convention this week to make the case for why the VP could be fruitful for Corporate America, CNBC reported Wednesday.Harris has presented herself as a pro-business promising to make things easier for newcomer entrepreneurs by cutting "needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape." While also courting and getting support from labor unions.However, the vice president has not rolled out a detailed economic plan. Critics have said that the proposals released so far on price-gouging bans or first-time homebuyer subsidies are light on specifics, while policies, like a hike on corporate taxes, are a carryover from the Biden administration.In broad strokes, the campaign has so far focused on support for middle and lower-income Americans, Business Insider\'s Laila Maidan reported.A spokesperson for the Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Cuban has already expressed support for Harris and defended some of her policy proposals. But, he added in an email to BI, "the devils in the details."Here are a few points that Cuban shared with us on qualities and policy approaches Harris has that he believes other CEOs would like to see.Cuban told BI in an email that he\'s looking for a candidate who is "not an ideologue," a perhaps not-so-subtle jab at Harris\' Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly been described as such by his critics.The billionaire added that he wants someone "pragmatic and open-minded. All of which she is."Another quality Cuban said he sees in Harris that sets her apart from Trump is her self-awareness — and that\'ll help her when she\'s trying to reel in business leaders, Cuban wrote."One of the things that makes KH stand apart from the Republican nominee is that she is self-aware," he wrote. "She knows what she doesn\'t and is willing to listen to business(es), from the smallest corner yogurt shop to the giants of industry."Cuban argued that Harris is a pro-business candidate who wants to support companies and businesses while also lifting up their employees."She wants all businesses to succeed," Cuban wrote. "She just wants their employees to share in their success. Which I don\'t think any entrepreneur or CEO is going to disagree with."As a cryptocurrency investor, Cuban told BI in a separate conversation that he was interested in Harris\' pitch for "regulatory clarity" around the digital asset industry.Brian Nelson, a policy advisor to the Harris campaign, said during a Bloomberg News roundtable on Wednesday that the vice president will support the crypto market in a way that would allow it to flourish while ensuring safeguards."She\'s going to support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow," Nelson said during the conversation, acknowledging there is a need for "stable rules, rules of the road."Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad said on X that he has participated in a "number of discussions with the Harris team" and that Nelson\'s statement was a "second step in the right direction."This point may be more specific to folks like Cuban, who has championed lower costs for drugs through his discount pill-mailing service, Cost Plus Drugs.But the billionaire told BI that he appreciated Harris "talking about transparency in healthcare."While laying out her economic agenda at a rally on August 16, Harris vowed to lower to cost of prescription drugs, "demand transparency" around drug pricing, and cancel medical debt for millions of Americans."Of course, the devils in the details," Cuban added.

In September 2023, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) initiated civil proceedings against Bit Trade alleging that Bit Trade, a subsidiary of U.S. Payward Incorporated, failed to make a target market determination for the product before offering it to customers, despite being notified of concerns.

Between January 2020 and August this year, over 1,117 people have reported incidents of investment fraud to An Garda Síochána. 44 per cent of the reported incidents made reference to ‘Bitcoin’ or ‘Crypto’. Men are increasingly becoming the victims of this type of fraud and remain most at risk. The majority of victims in the past four years have been male (64 per cent) and those aged over 40 make up over half of all victims.

Many expected that repaid customers and creditors may dump their Bitcoins simultaneously, triggering a possible plunge in the digital currency\'s prices, especially as it still reels from the effects of the German government\'s massive selloffs.On the other hand, there are hopes that as MtGox nears the end of its repayment activities, the world\'s largest digital asset by market value may finally begin a significant uptrend."MtGox FUD has been around for a very long time, with each transfer triggering some market reaction.

[+] Democrats State Convention at the San Diego Convention Center on February 24, 2018 in San Diego, California. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Los Angeles Times via Getty Images U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (CA-D), a formidable force in U.S. politics, has long been a key figure in the financial regulation landscape. As the former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee (HFS) and the current ranking member, Waters is known for her cautious and critical approach to cryptocurrency, often emphasizing the need for strict regulation to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. In the wake of the 2022 crypto contagion season marked by the FTX scandal, a crypto bear market and several industry bankruptcies, Waters called for greater scrutiny and control by regulators and Congressional oversight committees. However, this week in a August 21st appearance on the Our Native Land podcast during the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, IL., hosted by Angela Rye, Tiffany Cross, and Andrew Gillum (with special guest Charlamagne Tha God), Waters signaled an evolution in her perspective. She explained that if Democrats regain control of the House and she resumes her role as Chair of the HFS committee, one of her top three priorities would be fostering innovation in artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and other emerging technologies. “We’ve got to move forward with AI, artificial intelligence, [and] cryptocurrency,” explained Waters in response to Gillum’s question regarding legislative priorities in a Democrat-led House of Representatives. These statements mark a turning point in Waters’ position and represent a notable departure from her earlier, more critical approach. MORE FOR YOU Will Beyoncé Perform At DNC’s Final Night?

Trump Denies Project 2025 Links In Response To Harris’ DNC Speech: ‘I Have Absolutely Nothing To Do With’ It Waters’ Crypto Skeptic Past Waters has consistently demonstrated a cautious and critical approach toward cryptocurrency. This was evident in several key instances where she took decisive actions to curb what she perceived as the risks posed by the rapidly growing, volatile crypto asset market. In June 2019, Waters took a firm stance against Facebook\'s proposed cryptocurrency, the Libra stablecoin (later renamed Diem). Just hours after Facebook unveiled Libra, Waters requested that the company pause its development of the digital currency. She expressed significant concerns about Facebook’s past behavior, particularly regarding data privacy and security, and highlighted the lack of a clear regulatory framework to protect investors and consumers in the cryptocurrency market. At the hearing, which I attended, Waters called for a moratorium on the development of Libra until Congress and regulators had the opportunity to thoroughly examine the project and its potential risks. This action underscored her deep skepticism about the role of large tech companies in the financial space and her commitment to ensuring robust regulatory oversight. In December 2020, Waters further solidified her position by urging then President-elect Joe Biden to rescind or closely monitor all cryptocurrency-related guidance issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under then Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks. Waters was particularly concerned about the OCC\'s guidance allowing national banks to hold stablecoin reserves and to provide cryptocurrency custody services. She viewed these actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to loosen regulations on the financial sector, potentially to the detriment of consumer protection and financial stability. In June 2021, Waters announced the formation of a Democratic House Working Group to evaluate cryptocurrencies. This group was tasked with engaging regulators and experts to better understand the implications of the growing crypto industry, particularly in light of incidents like the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, where bitcoin was used to pay a ransom. Waters’ establishment of this working group further highlighted her cautious approach, focusing on the need for thorough oversight and regulation. A New Direction: Pro-Web3 Economy Waters’ legislative focus aligns with recent statements from other members of Congress, including Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Wiley Nickel (D-NC), who strongly support bipartisan efforts to pass reasonable crypto regulation. During a "Crypto4Harris" town hall, Schumer expressed optimism about passing a bipartisan crypto bill before the year\'s end, marking a significant departure from the previously skeptical stance of many Democrats. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will also support policy efforts to encourage the growth of the cryptocurrency industry, one of her top campaign officials said Wednesday, signaling a departure from the current administration\'s open hostility and declared war on crypto. “She’s going to support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow," said Brian Nelson, senior advisor for policy for the Harris campaign, during a Bloomberg roundtable at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Waters’ turnabout, along with Harris\' campaign statements, indicates growing support for policies that foster the growth of the cryptocurrency industry, suggesting a more favorable regulatory environment under a potential Harris administration. This shift also suggests that Waters, along with other Democrats, recognizes the transformative potential of these technologies and the importance of ensuring that the U.S. remains competitive in the global digital economy. A pro-innovation stance aligns with a broader vision of economic inclusion and empowerment, particularly as the U.S. seeks to lead in the Fourth Industrial Revolution—a period powered by rapid technological advancement and the integration of digital, physical, and biological systems. Pro-Crypto Agenda Could Benefit Consumers and the Economy Waters’ new stance could have significant implications for the U.S. cryptocurrency industry. A pro-innovation approach from a key figure and skeptic like Waters might lead to more supportive regulatory frameworks that encourage the growth of the cryptocurrency market while still maintaining necessary consumer protections. This shift could pave the way for increased adoption of digital assets and greater integration of blockchain technology into the broader financial system. For American consumers, this change could mean greater access to financial tools that promote wealth-building and financial sovereignty, particularly for communities historically marginalized by traditional financial systems. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, providing opportunities for economic empowerment, especially for Black and Latino communities that have faced systemic barriers to wealth-building. By embracing these technologies, as I explained in my 2023 testimony before the HFS Subcommittee on Digital Assets, the U.S. can foster a more inclusive economy where anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet can participate, bypassing traditional and predatory gatekeepers and leveling the economic playing field. Moreover, Waters\' emphasis on learning and adapting to new technologies could signal a more collaborative relationship between regulators and the cryptocurrency industry. This might involve creating clearer regulatory guidelines that provide the industry with the certainty it needs to innovate and grow within the U.S., rather than being driven offshore by regulatory ambiguity. In turn, this could enhance the U.S.\'s position as a global leader in the Web3 economy, ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological innovation and economic growth. Back to the Future Waters\' recent comments mark a significant departure from her previous cautionary stance on cryptocurrency and suggest an acknowledgement that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay. As she positions herself for a potential return to leadership in the House Financial Services Committee, her reimagined agenda could be a catalyst for a new era of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S.—one that better balances the need for security and consumer protection with the imperative to foster technological advancement. The potential benefits of this shift are profound: it could promote economic inclusion, empower American consumers, and solidify the U.S.\'s role as a leader in the digital economy. The cryptocurrency industry, policymakers, and stakeholders will be closely watching how this evolution unfolds and what it means for the future of crypto assets and blockchain technology in America.

Taking to LinkedIn, Peiyuan Jin, a software Engineer intern in the US, said that he was interviewing for the Quant Developer Intern position at the California-based company. For the fourth round of the hiring process, he had an interview with the firm\'s CEO, Yao Meng. However, in his post, Mr Jin criticised Mr Meng for his "unprofessional and demeaning" behaviour. "From the start, as I began my self-introduction, he interrupted me to mock my experience as a software engineer at John Deere, expressing disbelief that a tractor company would even need software services," Mr Jin shared. He went on to say that when he tried to discuss his previous projects, Mr Meng kept interrupting with condescending questions and belittled him for not thinking big. Take a look at the post below: Mr Jin said that the CEO also boasted that once, as an intern, he convinced his manager to quit and join him in a crypto venture. "The interview, which lasted only 7 minutes, ended with him humiliating me by saying, "I\'m a billionaire because I think big, but look at you-you\'ve accomplished nothing\'" the intern revealed. Mr Jin ended his post by calling on higher management to be more respectful and professional while engaging with juniors. "No candidate should have to endure this kind of treatment, regardless of their background or the companies they\'ve worked for. Interviews should be a respectful and constructive dialogue, where both parties can engage meaningfully. I hope that by sharing this, others feel empowered to speak up about their experiences and that companies take responsibility to ensure their interview processes are fair, respectful, and professional," he wrote. Also Read | Indian Photographer Wins Big Award For Best Portrait With Budget iPhone Mr Jin shared the post just two days back. Since then, it has accumulated more than 2,500 reactions. In the comments section, users slammed the CEO. "Well done for calling this out. I\'ve had interviews where I get constantly interrupted, and where they constantly ask whether I\'ve used their favourite software (this isn\'t "thinking big" by the way - it\'s asking you why you don\'t think like them, which is actually kinda limited!). Both kinds of behaviour demonstrate that these aren\'t the companies you want to work for (even though that\'s quite painful to admit in today\'s job market)," wrote one user. "Wow It\'s really disheartening to hear about experiences like this. Interviews should be a space for constructive dialogue and mutual respect, not a platform for tearing someone down. Thanks for speaking up," commented another. "The fact that he was confused as to how tractor work today is a testament that he\'s not actually that serious," expressed a third user. "If he actually thought big he should\'ve asked about how a tractor company needs software services. I think you got lucky avoiding a company that doesn\'t have vision," commented a fourth user.', 'summary': 'A candidate who applied for an internship at a cryptocurrency firm recently shared what he described as the "worst interview experience" of his career with Yao Meng, the CEO of Trade Terminal.', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/youve-accomplished-nothing-intern-shares-worst-interview-experience-with-crypto-ceo-6400062', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/fs2f6qg_intern-pic_625x300_23_August_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-08-23 08:26:24', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.218}, {'id': 254749054, 'title': 'Crypto Courts the 2024 Vote', 'text': 'The last crypto boom left the industry cash-rich and reputation-poor, so they’re doing what any beleaguered industry does—donating to politicians.

While the promo – set to LCD Soundsystem\'s upbeat \'Dance Yrself Clean\' – keeps its cards close to its chest as to the how and why, with that three-word line, it makes it clear most of its characters aren\'t going to make it to the end credits alive, and yet I was still gobsmacked as just how much of a horror movie it truly is. Billed as everything from a psychological thriller to a dark comedy, the film follows cocktail waitress and aspiring nail artist Frida (Naomi Ackie), who\'s been itching to cross paths with King again, having shared a brief flirtation with him while working his annual gala the year before. In an attempt to get his attention, she and her best friend Jess (Alia Shawkat, on top, giggle-inducing form) swap their uniforms for silky dresses and infiltrate the party this time round – which leads to them to spend the evening with King and his fancy friends, before he whisks them all away to his private island. At first, the vacation feels like a dream: private suites, pool days, and delicious multi-course dinners, followed by drug-fueled, dance-filled nights. Christian Slater\'s Vic gets irritable whenever he doesn\'t have an umbrellaed drink in-hand, Cody (Simon Rex) insists on calling Sarah (Adria Arjona) \'babe\' despite her obvious disdain for the term, and everyone keeps stealing Jess\'s lighter, but who cares? The characters\' joy is so infectious, you get swept up in it as a viewer. So much so, that the trip\'s more unsettling aspects, like the non-English speaking housekeeper who seems to recognize Frida, and the island\'s venomous snake problem, barely even register. When Jess suddenly disappears, Frida realizes she keeps losing huge chunks of time, and the film turns into a bloodsoaked nightmare, then, it completely knocks you for six. You mean to tell me that\'s what\'s been going on?! Menacing Mike It seems a little glib to say, but Blink Twice sees Kravitz weaponize her real-life fiancé Tatum\'s natural charm to devastating effect. The movie opens with Frida watching a video of King apologizing for his behavior, as he confirms he\'s stepped down as CEO from his company KingTech – though what he did exactly is never divulged. Even so, that\'s all we need to know to assume he\'s probably Not a Good Dude, but much like Frida, we kind of forget about all that once he starts showering her with champagne, asking how she got the scar on her temple with caring curiosity, and making her laugh as they play kiss-chase on the lawn. It turns out, though, he\'s a wolf in sheep\'s clothing. "I wanted Slater King to be somebody that the audience felt comfortable and safe with, whilst also ensuring it would make sense that Frida would want to drop everything and leave with him," Kravitz recently told Zavvi. "If you\'re going to leave with a stranger, you have to make that connection feel real, so the audience never questions why." "[We] talked about lots of different versions of Slater," Tatum said at the LA premiere (via MSN). "The one thing that we both agreed upon is that we didn\'t want to do the very stereotypical movie moment in a thriller where you reveal the bad guy." The last part seems crucial in achieving Kravitz\'s vision here. King isn\'t a supervillain per se, but he\'s a man with immense wealth and power, and, well, what happens when all that goes to someone\'s head and twists their morality into something sinister. Kravitz, who co-wrote the script with E.T. Feigenbaum, does similarly clever work with some of the supporting characters, too, like Geena Davis\'s bumbling assistant Stacey and Levon Hawke\'s crypto whizzkid Lucas, who seem to represent those who witness, or even facilitate, gross abuses of power, through generational and gender-specific lenses. Reality bites So why did this film – one that admittedly made me chuckle and want to hop on Booking.com at the earliest possible convenience – leave me so shell-shocked? I\'m a horror-loving gorehound who barely flinches at most things these days. But it\'s because Kravitz injects so many small, toe-curlingly relatable moments in amongst the magical realism. We\'re not dealing with demons, killer clowns, or sharks here, we\'re faced with evils that are terrifyingly human. Even when I\'ve seen a genre movie in the cinema late at night, I walk the 30 minutes from the train station home; I\'m pretty certain there are no ghosts and ghoulies lurking around Maidstone. After Blink Twice? I got a cab. "I felt like there was a lot more that needed to be discussed, but there wasn\'t really a place to say these things, and it didn\'t feel safe to say them out loud," Kravitz told the San Francisco Chronicle, as she remembered starting to write the script back in 2017, as the #MeToo movement looked to be simmering down. "So I started writing because I wanted to express these feelings and thoughts and because I wanted to try and highlight the absurdity of what society asks or expects of women." Clearly inspired by what used to go on on Jeffrey Epstein\'s Epstein Island, and other horrific true events, Kravitz has conjured up something that achieves the perfect balance between entertaining thrills and uncompromising, rageful message, which is no mean feat nowadays. Forgetting may be a "gift", as King suggests towards the end of Blink Twice, but I won\'t be shaking this one off any time soon. Blink Twice is in cinemas now.

That's been evidenced by the ongoing bankruptcy saga of Synapse, a San Francisco-based bank-as-a-service provider whose collapse has impacted nearly $160 million in user deposits across multiple fintech apps. Synapse operated a platform that allowed fintechs and other software firms to offer embedded banking and payment solutions to their customers. However, the company started experiencing turbulence last year with layoffs and struggles to maintain growth. This April, Synapse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and attempted to sell its assets, though a proposed acquisition fell through shortly after. With no path forward in sight, the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation in May. This triggered widespread fallout, as Synapse's various fintech partners like payroll app Juno and investment app Yotta could no longer provide banking services to users due to the loss of Synapse's infrastructure. It left millions without access to accounts holding around $158.6 million in aggregate deposits. Several other fintechs were also severely impacted. Crypto app Juno and lending platform Mainvest were among those forced to discontinue deposit and card offerings. Meanwhile, youth banking app Copper had to abruptly close all customer accounts. Senators have called on those involved to restore funds, but most of the $158.6 million remains inaccessible months later as reconciliation continues at a slow pace. While services to rebuild trust in the fintech space are still in high demand, Synapse's troubles serve as a cautionary reminder of the interconnected risks inherent in the rapidly evolving digital banking ecosystem.

If you're looking for a place to build a business, there's one clear winner.", 'text': 'This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Amber Atherton, 33, about living in San Francisco, London, and New York as a startup founder. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I launched my company, Zyper, in 2016 in London. I moved from London to Palo Alto in December 2017 after getting into Y Combinator, a prestigious accelerator program for startup founders.Before the move, I spent a year raising a seed round and acquiring customers in London. We were building software designed to help brands connect with their top fans.I\'ve lived in the Bay Area, New York, and the UK while building and scaling Zyper.In 2020, Zyper was acquired by Discord. I joined Discord for two years and lived in San Francisco. Then, in 2023, I joined a venture capital firm called Patron as a partner. We invest pre-seed stage across the gaming and consumer internet space.I feel truly at home in California. While I\'ve loved living in London and NYC, the Bay Area has something special. The Valley is unparalleled as a place to focus, build, and invest in the future.I first moved to Palo Alto in 2017 with two engineers and a product manager from Zyper. It was close to Y Combinator\'s office in Mountain View.I\'d grown up between Hong Kong and England, and didn\'t know anyone in California, so I was lucky to land in Y Combinator. It gave me a community of founders and friends.I was struck by how suburban Palo Alto was. You might think it\'s a modern metropolis of glass and steel, but it\'s actually an American suburb with lawns and one-story houses.During the program, we had regular coaching, office hours with partners, social events with batch mates, and inspiring guest speakers. It was a supportive and competitive environment.I remember Y Combinator\'s Michael Seibel giving us a talk about why we should stay in the Bay Area after the program, highlighting the ecosystem and talent here. Lots of YC companies are still headquartered in the Bay Area.In January 2018, we began working with lawyers on a "Delaware flip," which meant moving our domicile to Delaware to make Zyper more attractive to US investors.I realized that if we wanted to grow, we needed to be in the US full-time, as there\'s a bigger market.I considered taking Seibel\'s advice and staying in the Bay Area, but in the end, we decided to move to New York, which was closer in time zone to the UK.We still had a team in London but didn\'t have anyone living in the Bay Area.I moved to New York in June 2018. It was tough going from Palo Alto, a hyper-focused environment, to a 24/7 city with a hundred million things to do.There\'s so much stimulation in the city — theatre, art, museums. I remember being distracted by the endless opportunities to attend parties and dinners.Meanwhile, San Francisco, where I moved later on, is a tech town. Everyone\'s always talking about building businesses, and it\'s easier to meet investors and potential hires.New York has a great founder talent pool and ecosystem, particularly in crypto and AI. As an investor, I know fantastic founders in New York who have no problem dealing with the pace and distractions. After the Bay Area, New York is the next-best market to invest in.But if you want to be laser-focused without distractions, you can\'t beat the Bay Area. About a year into my time in New York, I realized we should probably move back.We closed our New York and London offices at the end of 2019 and moved our business to San Francisco.Within Europe, the UK is highly regarded as a place for technical talent, and there are many success stories in the fintech space.A big advantage of the UK is that it has some of the best universities in the world, so there is a lot of great academic talent.I still visit the UK twice a year, which helps me stay connected with the scene and observe trends in the market. The UK is a tough place to scale a company that isn\'t fintech or rooted in academia.Market size is the most obvious reason. The VC and funding ecosystem is bigger in the US, particularly in Silicon Valley, plus there\'s a large exceptional talent pool, so there\'s a quicker trajectory from raising a pre-seed round to hiring the people you need to reach milestones.There\'s also a cultural appetite for risk in the US that isn\'t as strong in the UK. The very DNA of America is the American dream. Particularly in the Valley, there\'s a propensity for very quickly backing "zero-to-one ideas" and creating something entirely new.When I lived in the UK, I felt the pace was slower, but I think the tech ecosystem has improved. There are more angel investors and VC funds now, but the talent pool in the UK is still smaller than in the US.I think Brexit was a shame because it used to be easier to bring European tech employees over to work in UK.I can\'t see myself making a full-time return to the UK, but you never know what the future holds.I moved Zyper to San Francisco right before the pandemic hit.During the pandemic, there was a time when some people left the city for Miami and Austin, but I\'ve since seen positive signs of recovery and an influx of founders back to the Bay. AI companies like Nvidia are based here and driving innovation in the next computing wave.The next Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley.There are other emerging markets, like Korea, Brazil, and China, but I think there\'s something very special about the ecosystem and history of Silicon Valley. The largest software companies were built here.The only red flag for me would be politics getting in the way. It\'s good to have an independent body regulating AI for consumer protection, but if politicians overregulate or overtax the way AI is working, it might slow down technological advancement and potentially hinder economic growth.I think I\'ll live here for the rest of my life. If you are obsessed with building, investing, and the future of consumer behavior, Silicon Valley is irresistible.', 'summary': 'Startup founder Amber Atherton compares living in San Francisco, New York, and London.

She is also accused of "lying to her then-employer."FTX\'s \'illegal contribution\'According to the indictment, Bond\'s campaign falsely reported in the FEC Form 3 that a $300,000 transfer to the campaign\'s bank account was a loan from Bond to the campaign. The said figures turned out to be "an illegal contribution from the Exchange to the campaign."Furthermore, Bond allegedly "falsely characterized the $400,000 Exchange Payment as consulting income" from FTX in a House Ethics Form, but later admitted to a public relations consultant that she wasn\'t providing consulting services for the defunct exchange, and the exchange provided the said amount to help with her campaign.Possible jail time for crypto lobbyistBond is faced with up to 20 years in prison on four counts related to conspiracy on "unlawful campaign contributions." Her case is being handled by the Public Corruption Unit of the Attorney\'s Office.Her case comes to light as politicians gear up for the November elections.
