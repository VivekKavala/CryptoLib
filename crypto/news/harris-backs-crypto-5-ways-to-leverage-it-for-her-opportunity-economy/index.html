                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event Friday, ... [+] Sept. 20, 2024, in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. As Vice President Kamala Harris edges closer to a potential 2024 presidential win, her "Opportunity Economy" platform may present middle America with new avenues to engage with technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. While these financial technologies have often been framed as either the shadowy domain of criminals or Lambo driving crypto bros, Harris has the chance to carve out a balanced path between naysayers and carnival barkers—empowering Americans, and America, to thrive in the emerging Web3 economy. During a recent New York fundraiser, Harris made her most direct comments on crypto yet, promising to “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors.” Some industry leaders, like Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, expressed cautious optimism. Shirzad acknowledged via X/Twitter that such public statements are a clear departure from the Biden Administration’s regulatory wild west. However, the post comments show that others seek more than reassurances. Still others are under believe wrongly that because Harris is the current Vice President that she must implement new laws and policies immediately, showing a complete failure to of basic civics; namely the role of the Vice President and the three coequal branches of government. Despite being in the race for just six weeks, with only seven more to go, Harris’s platform is already being compared former President Donald Trump’s sudden embrace of bitcoin, and his promise to be the “crypto president”. During his four years in office, however, Trump did little to support the growth of these technologies, launching what became the Treasury Department’s Operation Hidden Treasure—the precursor to the more expansive anti-crypto Chokepoint 2.0, and publicly denouncing bitcoin as little more than a speculative asset used to fuel illegal activities. Moreover, his recent embrace of crypto has raised eyebrows. His family's newly announced DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, targeting accredited investors so close to the election, is sparking concerns about motives, ethics, and optics. Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as a response to failing governments, collapsing banks, and a loss of confidence in big business. Today, people are once again turning to crypto—not as a speculative asset for the elite, but as a tool for economic empowerment, leveling the playing field for everyone else. MORE FOR YOU Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, September 24 WWE Raw Recap: Jey Uso Wins His 1st Singles Title, Social Media Reacts Steady Surge Has New York Yankees On Verge Of AL East Title Over Baltimore Orioles The question for Harris, in this critical phase of a hotly contested presidential race, is: How can she break from President Biden's anti-crypto policies, executed by various regulators and oversight committees, and articulate a digital assets platform that aligns the economic needs of everyday Americans with the future opportunities in the rapidly evolving Web3 economy? How Digital Assets Can Power The "Opportunity Economy" Harris’s Opportunity Economy focuses on reducing inequality, empowering small businesses, and fostering entrepreneurship—objectives that align with decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers more than just wealth-building for the rich; it provides banking access to the unbanked, facilitates remittances, and lowers financial transaction costs, supporting Harris’s vision of an inclusive economy for families and small businesses. DeFi platforms and stablecoins are especially important for immigrants sending remittances, as crypto transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional wire transfers. Expanding crypto-friendly policies could help lower- and middle-income families benefit from these innovations. The results of a July 2024 Paradigm Democratic poll underscore the appeal of cryptocurrency within diverse communities. The survey found that 22% of Black Democrats, 25% of Hispanic Democrats, and 27% of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Democrats have purchased cryptocurrency—higher percentages than their white counterparts. Additionally, 28% of Black Democrats and 32% of Hispanic Democrats view crypto as playing a positive role in the U.S. economy. These statistics highlight an opportunity for Harris to tap into a base of voters already exploring decentralized financial systems as an alternative to traditional banking barriers. The demand for crypto as a means of leveling the financial playing field is significant. A March 2024 DCG/Harris Poll found that 80% of voters believe the current financial system favors elites, while 79% argue it lacks transparency. For many, cryptocurrency represents a pathway toward greater financial equity, with 77% of crypto-positive voters agreeing that crypto helps level the playing field. Harris’s Opportunity Economy message aligns with these sentiments, making it essential for her to continue engaging with this constituency. Bridging The Gap For Everyday Users The crypto community is closely watching Harris’s approach, as skepticism grows around Donald Trump’s crypto promises. His recently launched DeFi platform, accessible only to accredited investors and with a 20% token reserve for family members, raises concerns that his initiatives favor the Trump family and wealthy investors, over ordinary citizens. His claim that bitcoin could settle national debt has also drawn criticism for its impracticality. In contrast, Harris’s Opportunity Economy offers a more inclusive vision, benefiting not just institutions but also small businesses and immigrants using crypto for remittances. A balanced regulatory framework under her leadership could ensure cryptocurrencies serve the public without sacrificing consumer protections. With 19% of American voters—and even higher percentages in communities of color—owning cryptocurrency, Harris’s policies must focus on supporting everyday users, not just large investors. A Call For Concrete Action The crypto community is pushing for more than general statements from Harris. With Trump taking a more active role in engaging the industry—speaking at major events and embracing a pro-crypto stance—Harris faces mounting pressure to provide specific policy details. Harris’s challenge is to convince multi-issue pro-crypto voters that her administration will offer the regulatory clarity and innovation-friendly policies they seek while avoiding the pitfalls of her opponent's legally dubious promises. Stand With Crypto tweet on 9/23/2024 at 5:19 pm announcing VP Harris's "somewhat supportive" ... [+] statements on crypto. Twitter screentshot Industry groups like Stand with Crypto provide a potential roadmap, advocating for direct engagement with the legislative process to ensure individual users' needs are prioritized in future policymaking. Policies That Benefit Main Street, Not Just Wall Street Harris has an opportunity to build on the original vision of bitcoin, which was created as a response to an economic crisis and a breakdown of trust in traditional financial systems. To do so, she will need to outline a regulatory framework that benefits the people who need it most. Here are five steps Harris could take to ensure her policies serve Main Street, not just Wall Street: Create a Regulatory Framework That Protects Small Users: Harris could advocate for clear distinctions between personal crypto transactions and those conducted by large financial institutions, ensuring that small users—such as individuals using crypto for remittances—are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as corporate actors. Expand Financial Access Through DeFi: By promoting DeFi platforms, Harris could expand access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked. This includes supporting low-cost, crypto-based remittances and peer-to-peer lending. Support Blockchain Solutions for Small Businesses: Blockchain can reduce transaction fees and improve transparency for small businesses, particularly those in middle America looking to compete globally. Invest in Digital Literacy for Everyday Americans: By prioritizing blockchain education in public schools and community colleges, Harris could ensure that everyday Americans have the knowledge to safely and confidently engage with the digital economy. Avoid Regulatory Overreach That Stifles Innovation: Harris must advocate for balanced regulations that protect consumers without crushing innovation. This would include providing clearer guidelines for individual crypto users, ensuring they are not unduly penalized or caught in a web of overregulation. Why Harris’s Crypto Policy Matters For Everyday Americans Harris’s campaign rhetoric offers hope to everyday cryptocurrency users, but the community is looking for concrete action. Cryptocurrencies, born out of an economic crisis, now represent a chance for financial inclusion and empowerment—not just for institutions or the wealthy. Harris’s Opportunity Economy could pave the way for a new era of financial inclusion, enabling regular people to benefit from blockchain technology. In a polarized political climate, pro-crypto policies could unify young, diverse, and financially marginalized voters—key demographics for Harris. By aligning her crypto policies with financial empowerment, Harris could position herself as a leader in the digital economy, where blockchain and DeFi become tools for opportunity and equity.
