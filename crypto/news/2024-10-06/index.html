                    LEGO Shop Gets Briefly Hijacked by Crypto Scam
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might’ve seen a banner featuring a ton of
                            gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by
                            surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website
                            taken over hackers to .

                            According to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4,
                            on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring “Our new LEGO Coin is officially
                            out!” Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens
                            with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began
                            posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the
                            LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven’t been any other attempts to bring back the
                            banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO
                            Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you’re worried about that, Engadget confirmed
                            clicking that banner’s “buy now” link takes you to the collection.

                            How did this happen? LEGO isn’t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating
                            it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been “swiftly resolved.”
                            More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during
                            this time, and that customers “can continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified
                            and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.”

                            Despite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn’t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a
                            regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams
                            have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure
                            you’re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.

                            Understanding The Volatile Nature Of Cryptocurrencies

                            Crypto prices are highly susceptible to market trends, often reacting sharply to regulatory
                            news, technological developments, and macroeconomic shifts. In 2024, key factors influencing
                            performance include:

                            Regulatory developments in major economies

                            Advancements in blockchain technology

                            Increased institutional adoption

                            Global economic uncertainties

                            While some cryptocurrencies have delivered impressive returns, bitcoin's volatility has been
                            decreasing. This trend suggests a maturing market, potentially attracting more conservative
                            investors. However, the sector remains high-risk overall. Lack of regulation, potential
                            market manipulation and the speculative nature of many digital assets underscore the need
                            for careful research and risk management when investing in this space.

                            Criteria For Selecting The Top Crypto By YTD Performance

                            The ranking of top cryptocurrencies by Year-to-Date performance for October, 2024 uses a
                            scoring system that looks at several factors. The main factor is how much the
                            cryptocurrency's value has changed since January 1, 2024, which makes up 70% of the total
                            score. This focus on YTD performance helps identify cryptocurrencies that have grown the
                            most this year.

                            The scoring also considers the total value of all coins in circulation (market cap), which
                            accounts for 15% of the score. This helps include larger, more established cryptocurrencies.
                            The last 15% of the score looks at how many coins are available compared to the total
                            supply, with a lower ratio contributing positively to the score. This helps account for how
                            the cryptocurrency manages its coin distribution and potential dilution risks.

                            The analysis covers the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap from CoinMarketCap (as of
                            October 2, 2024), with complete data since January 1, 2024, . The scoring system normalizes
                            all these factors to ensure fair comparison across different cryptocurrencies. This method
                            aims to highlight cryptocurrencies that have shown strong growth this year while also
                            maintaining a solid market position and good management of their coin supply.

                            Pepe (PEPE)

                            Pepe Overview

                            Market Cap: $4.09B

                            Circulating Supply: 420.69T

                            Total Supply: 420.69T

                            YTD Performance: 649.75%

                            Pepe, a meme coin inspired by the Pepe the Frog character, has seen explosive growth in
                            2024. Launched in April 2023, it quickly gained traction in the crypto community. Unlike
                            many cryptocurrencies, pepe has no max supply cap, with its total and circulating supply
                            both at 420.69 trillion tokens.

                            Why Pepe Is A Top Choice

                            Pepe's astounding 649.75% YTD growth makes it the top performer in our list. This surge can
                            be attributed to its strong community engagement and the broader trend of meme coins gaining
                            mainstream attention. Its lack of a supply cap and reliance on social momentum make it a
                            high-risk, speculative asset. Pepe's performance underscores the volatile and often
                            unpredictable nature of the crypto market, especially in the meme coin sector.

                            Bitcoin (BTC)

                            Bitcoin Overview

                            Market Cap: $1.21T

                            Circulating Supply: 19.76M

                            Total Supply: 19.76M

                            YTD Performance: 44.79%

                            Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, continues to lead the market in 2024. Created in 2009, it
                            operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. Bitcoin's fixed maximum
                            supply of 21 million coins and its halving events contribute to its deflationary model,
                            contrasting with traditional fiat currencies.

                            Why Bitcoin Is A Top Choice

                            Bitcoin's 44.79% YTD growth and $1.21 trillion market cap demonstrate its ongoing relevance.
                            As the most recognized cryptocurrency, bitcoin benefits from widespread adoption and growing
                            institutional interest. Its deflationary model and predictable supply (currently at 19.76
                            million coins) are key factors in its value proposition. Despite its strong performance,
                            bitcoin remains subject to regulatory risks.

                            Market Cap: $3.97B

                            Circulating Supply: 7.38M

                            Total Supply: 7.38M

                            YTD Performance: 102.06%

                            Bittensor is a decentralized machine learning network. It aims to create a market for

                            project's native token, TAO, is used for governance and incentivizing network participants.

                            Why Bittensor Is A Top Choice

                            Bittensor's 102.06% YTD growth reflects increasing interest in AI-focused blockchain
                            projects. Its relatively low supply of 7.38 million tokens and $3.97 billion market cap
                            suggest strong demand. However, you should be aware that the AI crypto sector is still
                            emerging and may face technological and regulatory challenges.

                            BNB Overview

                            Market Cap: $79.45B

                            Circulating Supply: 145.93M

                            Total Supply: 145.93M

                            YTD Performance: 74.21%

                            BNB, formerly known as Binance Coin, is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain
                            ecosystem. It's used for transaction fees, trading fee discounts on Binance, and
                            participation in token sales on the Binance Launchpad.

                            Why BNB Is A Top Choice

                            BNB's 74.21% YTD increase and $79.45 billion market cap indicate its strong position in the
                            crypto ecosystem. Its performance is tied to the success of Binance and the BNB Chain
                            network. The alignment of circulating and total supply at 145.93 million tokens suggests
                            transparency in token distribution. However, regulatory scrutiny of centralized exchanges
                            could impact BNB's future performance.

                            Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Overview

                            Market Cap: $3.71B

                            Circulating Supply: 2.52B

                            Total Supply: 2.72B

                            YTD Performance: 118.37%

                            governance and accessing services within the ecosystem.

                            Why Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Is A Top Choice

                            FET's 118.37% YTD growth reflects the increasing interest in AI-blockchain integration. Its
                            $3.71 billion market cap suggests significant market interest. The difference between
                            circulating (2.52B) and total supply (2.72B) indicates potential for future token releases.
                            AI-focused crypto projects are still in early stages and face both technological and
                            regulatory uncertainties.

                            capitalization and a key player in the DeFi and NFT ecosystems.

                            Why Ethereum Is A Top Choice

                            Despite a modest 6.75% YTD growth, Ethereum's $293.20B market cap underscores its
                            significant role in the crypto space. Its performance reflects broader market trends and
                            ongoing developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. The alignment of circulating and total
                            supply at 120.37M tokens indicates transparency in issuance.

                            Shiba Inu Overview

                            Market Cap: $9.80B

                            Circulating Supply: 589.27T

                            Total Supply: 589.52T

                            YTD Performance: 60.88%

                            Shiba Inu is a meme-inspired decentralized cryptocurrency. Created in 2020, it gained
                            popularity as a community-driven project and has since expanded its ecosystem to include a
                            decentralized exchange and NFT platform.

                            Why Shiba Inu Is A Top Choice

                            SHIB's 60.88% YTD growth and $9.80B market cap demonstrate continued interest in meme coins.
                            Its large supply (589.27T circulating out of 589.52T total) distinguishes it from scarcer
                            assets. While its performance is notable, investors should be aware of the high volatility
                            and speculative nature often associated with meme coins.

                            Market Cap: $13.35B

                            Circulating Supply: 86.60B

                            Total Supply: 86.60B

                            YTD Performance: 43.16%

                            Why TRON Is A Top Choice

                            TRON's 43.16% YTD growth and $13.35B market cap reflect its established position in the
                            crypto market. The alignment of circulating and total supply at 86.60B tokens suggests
                            transparency in token distribution. TRON's performance is tied to its adoption in
                            decentralized applications and content distribution platforms. However, like all
                            cryptocurrencies, it faces regulatory and market risks.

                            Kaspa (KAS)

                            Kaspa Overview

                            Market Cap: $2.09B

                            Circulating Supply: 22.36B

                            Total Supply: 22.36B

                            YTD Performance: 421.52%

                            traditional blockchain networks.

                            Why Kaspa Is A Top Choice

                            Kaspa's impressive 421.52% YTD growth and $2.09B market cap indicate strong market interest
                            in its technological approach. The alignment of circulating and total supply at 22.36B
                            tokens suggests transparency in issuance. Newer cryptocurrencies can be subject to high
                            volatility and technical risks.

                            Sui Overview

                            Market Cap: $763.62M

                            Circulating Supply: 914.33M

                            Total Supply: 10.00B

                            YTD Performance: 66.23%

                            Sui is a layer-1 blockchain designed for high throughput and low latency. It uses a novel
                            consensus mechanism and data structure to enable fast and scalable decentralized
                            applications.

                            Why Sui Is A Top Choice

                            Sui's 66.23% YTD growth reflects market interest in scalable blockchain solutions. Its
                            $763.62M market cap, while smaller than some competitors, suggests room for potential
                            growth. The significant difference between circulating (914.33M) and total supply (10.00B)
                            indicates a controlled token release strategy. As a relatively new project, Sui may face
                            challenges in adoption and competition from established platforms.

                            Future Outlook For Cryptocurrencies In 2025

                            Governments worldwide are actively exploring ways to regulate digital assets, and the coming
                            year may bring a wave of new legislation. These regulatory shifts could reshape the crypto
                            market, making it important for participants to stay informed about legal developments in
                            their jurisdictions.

                            The potential introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies in various countries could
                            significantly impact the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, stablecoins are experiencing strong
                            growth in usage. If regulators don't impose strict limitations on stablecoins due to
                            potential competition with CBDCs, we may see even stronger performance in this sector.

                            Emerging trends to watch include the expansion of decentralized prediction markets,
                            AI-integrated blockchain projects, and Real World Asset tokenization initiatives. These
                            developments could open new avenues for blockchain technology applications and potentially
                            influence market dynamics in the coming year.

                            Bottom Line

                            The cryptocurrency market in 2024 exhibits a range of trends, from the explosive growth of
                            meme coins to the steady development of established projects. Key success factors include
                            community engagement, technological innovation, and integration with emerging technologies
                            like AI. However, investors should remain aware of the sector's inherent volatility,
                            regulatory uncertainties, and the speculative nature of many digital assets.

                            Looking ahead to 2025, the crypto landscape may be significantly shaped by incoming
                            regulations, the potential introduction of CBDCs, and advancements in blockchain
                            applications such as decentralized prediction markets and real-world asset tokenization.

                            Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

                            A cryptocurrency network purpose-built to enable smart contracts and decentralized
                            applications, Ethereum is powered by its native token, ether (ETH). In recent years,
                            Ethereum has established itself as a key technology for decentralized finance applications,
                            also known as DeFi.

                            Some investors believe in the potential of DeFi but prefer to avoid direct participation,
                            opting instead for exposure to ether’s price in their portfolios. They are betting that the
                            growth of DeFi applications will drive demand for ether, making it likely to appreciate in
                            value.

                            An Ethereum Spot ETF offers a simplified way for these investors to gain exposure to ether’s
                            market performance without the need to buy or manage the cryptocurrency directly. This
                            article will explain what an Ethereum Spot ETF is, how it functions and the essential
                            factors investors should consider before adding it to their portfolio.

                            What Is A Spot ETF?

                            A spot ETF, short for exchange-traded fund, is a type of fund that directly tracks the price
                            of an underlying asset, such as a commodity or cryptocurrency, by holding it in reserve.
                            Unlike a futures ETF, which is based on contracts speculating on future prices, a spot ETF
                            reflects the real-time value of its asset. Investors in spot ETFs gain price exposure to the
                            asset without needing to manage or store it directly.

                            Basics Of Spot ETFs

                            Spot ETFs are designed to simplify the investment process in certain types of assets. Here’s
                            how they work: A fund manager purchases some amount of the asset, holds it in custody, and
                            issues shares against it. Investors buy the shares, which represent fractional ownership of
                            the fund's asset holdings. If the fund is managed effectively, the price of the shares
                            should mirror the asset’s price on the spot market. This model lets investors gain exposure
                            to the asset’s spot price without the complications of asset management, such as storage or
                            security. Instead, they can simply buy and sell shares with a brokerage account.

                            How Spot ETFs Differ From Futures ETFs

                            The main difference between spot ETFs and futures ETFs lies in how they derive their value.
                            Spot ETFs hold assets in reserve and track its real-time price. In contrast, futures ETFs
                            rely on contracts that speculate on the asset's future price. This can lead to discrepancies
                            between the price of the shares of a futures ETF and the current market price of the
                            underlying asset. Futures ETFs can also exhibit phenomena like contango or backwardation,
                            where prices deviate from spot market prices due to the structure of futures contracts.

                            Importance Of Spot ETFs In Financial Markets

                            ETFs have become commonplace because they offer a streamlined way to bet on the price of
                            assets that may be challenging for some to hold directly. They were first introduced in the
                            early 1990s as a means to track the performance of stock indexes, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF
                            (SPY
                            Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF

                            SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust
                            ) being one of the earliest and most successful. Their appeal lies in their ability to offer
                            liquidity and ease of trading, similar to shares of a stock, while tracking the value of a
                            basket of assets that underpin them.

                            As ETFs evolved, they expanded beyond equities to include commodities like gold. Products
                            such as the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD
                            SPDR Gold Shares
                            ) lets you gain exposure to the price of gold using your brokerage account without the need
                            to physically store the metal. This financial innovation paved the way for ETFs to play a
                            similar role in other markets, including cryptocurrencies.

                            Spot ETFs for digital assets like bitcoin

                            and ether serve a similar function. Some investors would like to invest in these tokens but
                            would rather not develop the technical understanding needed to trade them directly. Spot
                            ETFs allow these investors to buy and sell ETF shares that represent the tokens without
                            needing to worry about the custody, security or liquidity of the underlying tokens
                            themselves.

                            What Is An Ethereum Spot ETF?

                            An Ethereum spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of ether.
                            Investors who buy shares in an Ethereum spot ETF gain exposure to ether’s price movements
                            without needing to buy, store and trade the tokens themselves. This type of ETF simplifies
                            Ethereum investment for traditional traders by providing a familiar way of participating in
                            the market.

                            How Does An Ethereum Spot ETF Work?

                            An Ethereum spot ETF works by purchasing ether and holding it in custody on behalf of its
                            investors. The value of the shares of the ETF is tied directly to the price of ether in the
                            spot market. Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage
                            accounts, just like any other stock or fund. The ETF is structured such that the price of
                            its shares should move in tandem with ether’s spot price as closely as possible.

                            Key Features Of Ethereum Spot ETFs

                            Ethereum spot ETFs are known for their transparency and simplicity. They offer a direct link
                            to ether’s spot price, making them an ideal investment vehicle for those who want to follow
                            the market without holding the asset. Key features include full backing by actual ether,
                            daily liquidity for buying and selling shares, and regulatory oversight to ensure compliance
                            and security. As with many other funds, Ethereum spot ETFs will likely require the payment
                            of fees to the managers of the fund.

                            Benefits Of Investing In An Ethereum Spot ETF

                            Ethereum spot ETFs can benefit certain types of investors. They offer exposure to the price
                            of ether without the need to manage a crypto wallet. They provide a familiar investment
                            experience, allowing anyone with a brokerage account to buy and sell shares, both short and
                            long. For those who wish to participate in the market for ether, but prefer not to deal with
                            the technical complexities of cryptocurrency, an Ethereum spot ETF offers a convenient
                            solution.

                            Direct Exposure To Ethereum

                            One of the primary benefits of an Ethereum spot ETF is that it offers exposure to ether’s
                            market price. This allows them to capture gains if the Ethereum network grows and ether
                            appreciates just as if they were holding the digital asset itself, without the need to
                            manage wallets and private keys. Ethereum spot ETFs also allow investors to sell short,
                            letting them profit from anticipated price declines.

                            Simplicity And Convenience

                            Investing in an Ethereum spot ETF is simple and convenient, especially for those who may be
                            unfamiliar with managing digital assets. Purchasing shares through a traditional brokerage
                            account eliminates the need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet and secure private keys. The
                            ETF structure also allows for easy buying and selling, making it a practical solution for
                            investors who want to participate in the ether spot market without the technical hurdles of
                            direct ownership.

                            Regulatory Protection And Transparency

                            Ethereum spot ETFs offer the benefit of regulatory protection, as they are subject to
                            oversight by financial regulators. An ETF provides a regulated framework with transparent
                            reporting. To the extent that investors trust the regulatory regime in charge of overseeing
                            the managers of the fund, investors can have peace of mind that their assets are being
                            managed responsibly.

                            Diversification In Investment Portfolios

                            One way of diversifying an investment portfolio is to include shares of an Ethereum spot
                            ETF. Ethereum has become a key component of decentralized finance (DeFi). Those who see
                            strong potential for growth of this technology, and who trust the management team and
                            governance of the Ethereum Foundation, believe ether is an attractive investment. By
                            including an Ethereum spot ETF in their portfolios, these investors can add ether price
                            exposure to their investment mix.

                            Risks And Considerations Of Ethereum Spot ETFs

                            As with any investment, Ethereum spot ETFs carry risks. Understanding the risk factors
                            associated with them will help you make an informed decision about whether they align with
                            your financial goals.

                            Volatility Of Ethereum Prices

                            The price of ether, like many cryptocurrencies, is volatile. Rapid price swings can lead to
                            significant gains, but they can also result in considerable losses. Ethereum spot ETFs track
                            the real-time price of ether, so they expose investors to this volatility. This offers the
                            potential for both large returns and large losses, making it essential for you to assess
                            your risk tolerance before investing.

                            Regulatory Risks And Uncertainties

                            Cryptocurrency markets are relatively young, and regulation of Ethereum and other digital
                            asset networks is evolving quickly. Regulatory actions can influence the price of ether
                            independently of the Ethereum Network's inherent utility or value, which might otherwise
                            thrive in a free and unregulated market. These actions can create artificial market
                            pressures, driving prices up or down regardless of the network's underlying performance or
                            potential.

                            Counterparty Risk

                            One of the key risks to consider with Ethereum spot ETFs is counterparty risk associated
                            with the Ethereum Foundation. This organization, which oversees the Ethereum Network, holds
                            significant influence. For example, the Merge, which transitioned Ethereum from
                            proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022, was a monumental change that directly
                            impacted the price of ether and demonstrated how these types of decisions could affect
                            market dynamics. Such governance changes present risks, as future upgrades could have
                            unforeseen effects on the network’s performance and the value of ether.

                            Management Fees And Costs

                            Ethereum spot ETFs, like most other funds, come with management fees that can eat into
                            potential profits. While these fees are generally lower than those associated with
                            futures-based ETFs or actively managed funds, investors should still consider them when
                            calculating potential returns. It’s important to choose an ETF with a competitive fee
                            structure to maximize gains from ether’s price movements.

                            Market Liquidity And Trading Risks

                            Although ETFs are generally known for their liquidity, market conditions can impact the
                            ability to buy or sell shares at the desired price. During periods of high volatility, the
                            price of shares of an Ethereum spot ETF may deviate from the underlying asset’s value. In
                            times of low market liquidity, it might be harder to sell shares, posing risk to investors.

                            Ethereum Spot ETFs Vs Other Crypto Investment Choices

                            Ethereum spot ETFs are just one of several ways to invest in cryptocurrency. Compared to
                            other options, they offer a simple and familiar trading experience. Investors should
                            consider how they compare to holding ether tokens on an exchange or in self-custody.

                            Direct Purchase Of Ethereum

                            Purchasing ether directly gives investors full control over the asset, including the ability
                            to use them in decentralized applications (dApps) and transfer them to other people. Direct
                            ownership comes with the responsibility of managing private keys, which can be daunting for
                            some. An Ethereum spot ETF removes this complexity. On the other hand, shares of an Ethereum
                            spot ETF cannot be used in smart contracts on the Ethereum network like ether can.

                            Ethereum Futures ETFs

                            Ethereum futures ETFs track the expected future price of ether based on futures contracts,
                            rather than the current spot price. These funds can deviate significantly from ether’s
                            market performance due to factors like contract expiration dates and market speculation. In
                            contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs offer a more direct and immediate reflection of ether’s price,
                            making them a better fit for many people.

                            Crypto Funds And Trusts

                            Crypto funds and trusts, such as the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), offer exposure to
                            ether, but often trade at premiums or discounts to its market price. Additionally, these
                            funds may have higher management fees compared to ETFs. Ethereum spot ETFs tend to offer
                            better liquidity, lower fees and more transparent pricing, making them a preferable option
                            for many people.

                            The Future Of Ethereum Spot ETFs

                            The future of Ethereum spot ETFs depends on a few factors. Most of all, it depends on the
                            Ethereum Foundation. This organization is responsible for the development roadmap of the
                            Ethereum Network, and a small group of decision makers have control over the expansion and
                            contraction of the supply of ether tokens. If the supply of ether were to dramatically
                            increase while demand stays roughly the same, the price of ether could crash.

                            On the other hand, decentralized finance (DeFi) technology could make financial services
                            significantly faster, cheaper and more reliable than they have been in the past. If
                            regulators create an environment where DeFi is allowed to thrive, the Ethereum Network could
                            grow significantly, leading both retail and institutional investors to view the ether token
                            as an attractive investment.

                            Bottom Line

                            Ethereum spot ETFs offer a simplified, regulated way to gain exposure to ether’s price
                            without the need to directly hold and manage it. For people who want to participate in
                            Ethereum’s growth, particularly as decentralized finance (DeFi) expands, these funds provide
                            a convenient entry point. However, like all investments, they come with risks, including
                            volatility, regulatory uncertainty, counterparty risk and management fees. Carefully
                            considering these factors is crucial before adding shares of Ethereum spot ETFs to your
                            portfolio.

                            Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

                            Is An Ethereum Spot ETF A Good Investment?

                            Ethereum spot ETFs can be a good investment for those seeking exposure to ether’s price
                            without the technical complexities of holding ether in direct custody. However, they carry
                            their own set of risks, so it’s essential to assess your risk tolerance and financial goals.

                            What Is The Difference Between An Ethereum Spot ETF And A Futures ETF?

                            An Ethereum spot ETF tracks the real-time price of ether, while a futures ETF is based on
                            contracts speculating on ether’s price on some date in the future. Spot ETFs are more
                            accurate for tracking today’s market price of ether.

                            Can I Hold An Ethereum Spot ETF In My Retirement Account?

                            Yes, many brokerage accounts allow you to hold shares of Ethereum spot ETFs in
                            tax-advantaged retirement accounts like IRAs, offering a way to gain exposure to ether
                            within a traditional brokerage account.

                            Are There Any Tax Implications Of Investing In An Ethereum Spot ETF?

                            Yes, gains from selling shares of Ethereum spot ETFs may be subject to capital gains tax,
                            depending on your country’s tax laws. Consult a tax advisor in your jurisdiction to
                            understand the tax implications of buying and selling shares of Ethereum spot ETFs.

                            mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto—who disappeared in 2011—has become one of the most
                            fascinating legends of the modern age.

                            The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has remained a mystery even as bitcoin has won over the
                            likes of Wall Street giant BlackRock, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and world leaders.

                            Now, as some fear Satoshi Nakamoto’s unmasking could destroy bitcoin completely, a new

                            destroy.
                            AFP via Getty Images

                            A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at
                            9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator
                            Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico.

                            In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will "present a
                            compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be" without going so far as to claim any sort
                            of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence.

                            Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1
                            million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around
                            $66 billion at current prices.

                            Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a
                            cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary,
                            attracting 38% of punters.

                            However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was
                            unimpressed by the technology.

                            "Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting," Sassaman
                            posted, adding in a separate post that "digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's
                            bunk."

                            Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin
                            transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief
                            executive Adam Back.

                            However, the prediction market site is also putting an 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity
                            not being proven in 2024.

                            Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—when they were still
                            posting on the BitcoinTalk forum—have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was
                            recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine.

                            Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two
                            weeks.

                            If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is
                            moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what
                            could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

                            The bitcoin price has surged this year, topping its previous all-time high and reigniting
                            interest ... [+] in the real identify of bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
                            Forbes Digital Assets

                            U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the
                            unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business.

                            "The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed
                            bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s bitcoins" as a risk factor," the company’s prospectus
                            read.

                            Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto
                            conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence,
                            ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control.

                            A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by
                            "out hashing" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they
                            would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence

                    Kremlin Allocates $948 Million to Bolster Crypto-Mobilization Amid Ongoing War in Ukraine.
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The Russian government plans to allocate 90 billion rubles ($948 million) between 2025 and
                            2027 for one-time payments to individuals signing military contracts with the Russian
                            Ministry of Defense, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

                            This substantial financial commitment suggests that the Kremlin intends to continue relying
                            on its “crypto-mobilization” efforts to meet manpower requirements for the ongoing war in
                            Ukraine.

                            The so-called crypto-mobilization refers to continuously recruiting smaller reservists,
                            which operates alongside larger-scale conscription campaigns and other mobilization efforts.
                            Russia has been conducting various campaigns to attract “volunteers” to sign contracts with
                            its armed forces, offering increasingly lucrative financial incentives to sustain its war
                            effort.

                            The Russian federal government currently offers a one-time payment of 400,000 rubles
                            ($4,200) for signing a military contract, with some regional governments offering payments
                            exceeding one million rubles.

                            These financial incentives suggest that the Kremlin is seeking to recruit an estimated
                            225,000 personnel through contract service between 2025 and 2027. However, this goal may
                            require even higher payments, as the rates have steadily increased since 2022.

                            The Kremlin’s increased financial incentives reflect concerns that current recruitment
                            efforts may not be sufficient to maintain the required number of new forces to support its
                            military operations in Ukraine.

                            Despite these enhanced payments, ISW assesses that there are medium- to long-term
                            limitations on how many recruits the ongoing crypto-mobilization can generate. Simply
                            increasing financial incentives may not be enough to address these constraints.

                            Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to crypto-mobilization as a means of
                            avoiding a widely unpopular full-scale mobilization. However, ISW notes that Putin still has
                            the option of declaring another partial mobilization, as he did in the fall of 2022, should
                            the situation in Ukraine deteriorate further.

                            Putin and the Russian military leadership appear unwilling to reduce the intensity of
                            operations in Ukraine, viewing the maintenance of the theater-wide initiative as
                            strategically critical. It remains uncertain how the Kremlin will respond if faced with
                            another significant manpower crisis similar to that experienced in the latter half of 2022.

                    PayPal’s Investments Are Leading The Mass Adoption Of Crypto Payments
                </h3>

                            PayPal continues to lead in TradFi crypto payments Getty Images Although PayPal has been
                            active in the crypto sector since 2014, in the form of allowing individuals to conduct
                            transactions using certain specific cryptocurrencies, the firm has recently made significant
                            efforts to encourage crypto payments. Notably the launch of a proprietary stablecoin – PYUSD
                            – in August 2023 was an unambiguous signal that the payment giant was making a direct play
                            for crypto investors and users. September 2024 revealed even more positive indications for
                            the crypto sector and crypto payments as PayPal will now allow merchant (business) customers
                            and accounts to buy, sell, and hold crypto directly from their merchant wallets. With over
                            400 million customers worldwide and 36 million merchant accounts these developments and
                            investments are positioned to drive significant adoption of crypto-for-payments moving
                            forward. It is also worth noting that PayPal, with a market capitalization of nearly $80
                            billion, holds approximately 45% of the global payments market share, solidifying its
                            position as a leading payment processor globally. Suffice it to say that the investments
                            made at PayPal continues to not only serve as an example of how TradFi has pivoted to crypto
                            payments, but also has encouraged other payment processors to follow suit. Let’s take a look
                            at a few of the specific items that investors should keep an eye on as PayPal continues its
                            evolution into a crypto-fiat payment giant. Regulated Payment Processors Extend Leadership
                            Even with the launch of crypto projects by Presidential candidates, the continued resurgence
                            of decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens taking new forms, and stablecoin issuers
                            growing in market capitalization, regulated entities continue to exercise growing
                            leadership. With efforts underway by TradFi institutions to launch crypto ETFs, stablecoins
                            being issued by financial institutions, and legislative promises being discussed by both
                            political parties the reality is regulated financial entities are extending collective
                            leadership over the crypto space. Such developments have been decried by some of the bitcoin
                            maximalist community, but the fact is that consumers (or merchants) are going to want to
                            capture the benefits of tokenized payments but do so with the safeguards and frameworks of
                            established payment processors. Insurance, customer service, and the ability to correct,
                            undo, or otherwise mitigate erroneous transactions are necessary components that all crypto
                            users are going to expect as crypto becomes integrated into more payment options and
                            institutions moving forward. Interoperability Will Became A Requirement One of the more
                            interesting developments that was included in the announcement of crypto integration for
                            merchant payments is that merchant customers that use crypto will have the ability to
                            transfer holdings into other hot wallets, or even transfer holdings into cold wallets.
                            Interoperability has long been a work-in-progress for organizations seeking to develop mass
                            market solutions. For example, even a simple-sounding process like allowing holders of
                            bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) to access the many Layer 2 application developed on the
                            ethereum blockchain (with the second largest token ether) has required 1) the development of
                            wrapped bitcoin, and 2) a significant effort by the bitcoin developer community to create
                            products such as bitcoin smart contacts and ordinal (bitcoin NFTs). Read More: Why The Ether
                            ETF Has Underperformed Versus Bitcoin PayPal, in logical alignment with its current position
                            as a leader in the individual and entrepreneurial payment space, is emphasizing
                            interoperability and flexibility to allow customers increased functionality. Tax Treatment
                            Remains An Obstacle Despite all of these positive developments and innovation put forward,
                            crypto taxes remain an ongoing and substantial obstacle toward wider utilization of crypto
                            for payment purposes. Even for stablecoins, whose sole purpose are to be used as a medium of
                            exchange, the tax liability and reporting purposes remains exactly the same as for
                            cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Adding to this complication are tax changes that are going
                            to be rolled out connected to IRS Code Sections 6045 and 6050I. Lastly, reporting
                            requirements for stablecoin transactions have been modified and exempted for the time being,
                            but the $25,000 de minimis exemption for stablecoins do not provide as much assurance for
                            merchants as it does for individuals. Crypto taxes have long been a complicated and rapidly
                            changing aspect of the crypto landscape, and while usage and innovation continue to
                            accelerate among both TradFi and crypto-native organizations, the tax and tax reporting
                            issues continue to create headaches for tax advisors and crypto advocates alike. TradFi
                            continues to make inroads into the crypto payment space, and firms like PayPal are leading
                            the way for mass crypto adoption.

                            The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing pivotal shifts as users seek more effective ways
                            to manage, trade, and safeguard their digital assets. Amid these transformations, Plus
                            Wallet emerges as a key player by blending security with the potential for increased returns
                            through its innovative Swap to Earn feature. This dual functionality not only secures users’
                            assets but also turns every trade into a potential gain, setting Plus Wallet apart as an
                            optimal choice for those aiming to enhance their digital asset portfolios while maintaining
                            security. Revenue and Debate Sparked by Uniswap’s Updated Fee Structure In April 2024,
                            Uniswap implemented a revised fee structure, imposing a 0.25% fee on all trading pairs
                            except those involving stablecoins and Wrapped Ethereum. This adjustment has substantially
                            increased its revenue, as evidenced by DefiLlama’s data showing nearly $53 million generated
                            from April to September. Despite this financial boost, the fee modification has sustained
                            Uniswap’s market presence with an $8.1 billion seven-day volume, yet it has also attracted
                            criticism. The increased fees are perceived to benefit corporate equity disproportionately
                            over UNI token holders. Additionally, the adjustment has attracted SEC scrutiny, adding a
                            layer of complexity to its operational environment. Revitalization of Crypto NFTs within the
                            Gaming Industry Crypto NFTs are transcending their initial surge of popularity, finding new
                            vigor within the gaming sector. Major gaming corporations such as Ubisoft and Square Enix
                            are integrating blockchain technology into their newest releases, allowing players to
                            possess, exchange, and monetize in-game assets. This integration is transforming player
                            interaction with game content, signaling a significant shift in digital entertainment
                            dynamics. Moreover, startups are innovating by converting static NFTs into interactive,
                            playable characters, enhancing their practicality and appeal in gaming. This trend points to
                            a robust future for NFTs within the gaming industry, suggesting their enduring relevance and
                            potential impact. These developments illustrate the evolving nature of cryptocurrency
                            utilization and security, underscoring the strategic importance of adaptive technologies
                            like Plus Wallet in facilitating user gains while ensuring robust asset protection. As the
                            sector continues to evolve, tools that offer both profitability and security will be crucial
                            for users looking to navigate this dynamic financial landscape effectively. Plus Wallet

                    Lego's website was hacked to promote a crypto scam
                </h3>

                            People who visited Lego's website on the evening of October 4 were welcomed by a banner with
                            illustrated golden coins bearing the company's logo, claiming that the "Lego coin" is now
                            officially out. It even promised "secret rewards" to those who'd buy some. But Lego wasn't
                            truly launching an official cryptocurrency coin, and according to The Brick Fan, the button
                            to buy led to an external cryptocurrency website selling "LEGO Tokens" with Ethereum. The
                            website was, seemingly, hijacked by bad actors who switched its banner and used it for some
                            sort of crypto scam. As users on the Lego subreddit have noted, the incident happened
                            overnight for Lego's headquarters. The company responded relatively quickly, though, and
                            removed the unauthorized banner and links. As of this writing, the Lego Fortnite
                            collaboration banner is back up, and the "buy now" link leads to the collection. Lego told
                            Engadget that no user accounts were compromised and that it has identified the cause of the

                            Grammy-nominated rap star Robert Bryson Hall II, known professionally as Logic, belongs to a
                            niche list of music celebrities with significant investments in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the
                            world's largest cryptocurrency. What happened: Way back in November 2020, the rapper, known
                            for the chartbuster song "1-800-273-8255," disclosed on Instagram that he purchased $6
                            million worth of the cryptocurrency. Don't Miss: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin

                            Seriously," Logic said in a video posted on his Instagram story. The revelation followed an
                            earlier X (then Twitter) post where he wrote, "My manager Chris Zarou has been bugging me,
                            so I finally made a big investment in Bitcoin." Trending: The global games market is

                            disclosure, one BTC was valued at $17,817.09. So, an investment of $6 million would have
                            fetched him about 336.75 units of the cryptocurrency. Today, one BTC is worth $60,228.31,
                            meaning that Logic's stash would be equivalent to $20.282 million, marking a significant
                            238% return on investment. Note that this calculation assumes that Logic didn't sell his

                            for his album “Animal Ambition” 10 years ago. He collected as many as 700 Bitcoins. Eminem,
                            another rap legend, mentioned Bitcoin in the popular track “Not Alike” from the best-selling
                            album “Kamikaze.” Nas, regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, placed a bet on
                            Bitcoin as early as 2014, predicting that the asset would grow bigger than the internet.

                            on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin. In July, Cuban

                            bitcoin price higher. Forbes Digital Assets Earlier, during an appearance at the Bitcoin
                            2024 conference, Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and
                            predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization. Speaking in
                            September at the Economic Club of New York, Trump proposed creating a government efficiency
                            commission and said Elon Musk had agreed to "head that task force"—with Musk branding it the
                            Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Both Musk and Cuban have helped dogecoin—a
                            tongue-in-cheek fork of bitcoin—become one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies over the
                            last few years. The dogecoin price rocketed along with bitcoin and the wider crypto market
                            in 2021 before crashing back but holding on to far more of its value than most of its

                    New Solana meme coin Pochita turns $140 Into $450,000 in just 24 hours

                            The New Solana meme coin Pochita captured headlines after new values skyrocketed in weeks,
                            and even a small investment turned into a fortune. Indeed, the Pochita coin was introduced
                            after the acceptance of a new dog called Pochita based on the meme-famous dog from Solana’s
                            BONK coin. Before long, meme coins were popping left and right, but one coin would stand out
                            and capture traders’ attention. Crypto traders, often called “degens,” were fast to get a
                            piece of the action, and one trader identifiable only by their wallet address, “AjwF,” made
                            an early bet on the New Solana meme coin Pochita. AjwF bought a minute after the token had
                            launched on Pump, just for 1 SOL, which amounted to about $140 at the time, making it the
                            19th buyer. This time, although he had spent money on two other Pochita-themed coins before,
                            which gained no popularity at all, the trader hit the jackpot. Within a day, this New Solana
                            meme coin Pochita saw explosive growth, turning the $140 wagered by AjwF into an incredible
                            $450,000. Curiously, despite such a mega-profit, AjwF has only withdrawn $450 worth of
                            tokens and still holds 2.18% of the total supply of Pochita, making it the biggest holder.
                            As the market cap of Pochita increased overnight to $22 million, other early investors sold
                            their tokens at such a price when the hype was on; AjwF, however, held firm. New Solana meme
                            coin Pochita is explosive at its launch, but was there any insider trading? Blockchain
                            analysis firm Bubblemaps didn’t find any indication of insider trading from the early
                            buyers. Pochita, the New Solana meme coin, wasn’t being manipulated by an insider. Market
                            cap peaked at $35 million and declined by 45%. As expected in the volatility that
                            characterizes memes, the market cap shrank to this level. AjwF chose to stay and distribute
                            his funds across several wallets. Just like the moo deng millionaire of the meme coin, AjwF
                            held and distributed his funds into the various wallets. While meme coins like the New
                            Solana Meme Coin Pochita look explosive, they are TOTALLY RISKY. Recently, Dallas Mavericks
                            owner Mark Cuban weighed in on meme coins saying they were “fun” but “really darn risky,”
                            noting that it’s “a rug pull in the works.” Yet the hype is so sensationalized that traders
                            continue to flood meme coins. The unpredictability of these investment products is best
                            exemplified by the price rally of Pochita and the other Solana meme coins like BONK and WIF
                            during October. AjwF will remain in the hearts of every trader because, as more attention is
                            brought to the New Solana meme coin Pochita, they watch for the possibility that AjwF will
                            cash out or ride the wave to find another peak for the value of his tokens. Also, see:

                            Pig butchering, the crypto-based scammer scourge that has pulled in an estimated $75 billion
                            from victims globally, is spreading beyond its roots in Southeast Asia, with operations
                            proliferating across the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. The
                            UK's National Crime Agency disclosed new details about the identities of the Russian
                            ransomware group known as Evil Corp—as well as the group's ties to Russian intelligence
                            agencies and even its direct participation in espionage operations targeting NATO allies. A
                            WIRED investigation revealed how car-mounted automatic license plate reader cameras are
                            capturing far more than just license plates, including campaign yard signs, bumper stickers,
                            and other politically sensitive text, all examples of how a system for tracking vehicles
                            threatens to become a broader surveillance tool. In other news, ICE signed a $2 million
                            contract with Paragon Solutions, a known vendor of spyware including the hacking tool
                            Graphite. And the Pentagon is increasingly adopting handheld controllers for weapons systems

                            stay safe out there. The FBI Still Hasn’t Cracked the Phone of Indicted NYC Mayor Eric Adams
                            As the politics of America's biggest city have been turned upside down by the criminal
                            charges against New York mayor Eric Adams, there's still a “significant wild card” in the
                            corruption case against him, prosecutors said in court this week: The FBI can't manage to
                            get into his phone. Prosecutors in the case against Adams, which centers on alleged illegal
                            payments the mayor received from the Turkish government, revealed that the FBI still hasn't
                            cracked the encryption on Adams' personal phone, nearly a year after it was seized. That
                            phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams'
                            personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By
                            that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six
                            digits—a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally
                            deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately “forgot” that code to
                            unlock it. That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation
                            similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed
                            Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's
                            encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that
                            case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded—and expensive—hacking
                            technique to unlock the device. In Adams' case, prosecutors hinted that the FBI may have to
                            resort to similar measures. “Decryption always catches up with encryption,” a prosecutor in
                            the case, Hagan Scotten, told the judge. Harvard Students Add Face Recognition to Meta’s
                            Smart Glasses Face recognition is one of only a few technologies that even Facebook and
                            Google have hesitated to integrate into products like Google Glass and the Ray-Ban Meta
                            smart glasses—and rightly so, given the privacy implications of a device that would allow
                            anyone to look at a stranger on the street and immediately determine their phone number and
                            home address. Now, however, a group of Harvard students has shown how easy it is to bolt
                            that face recognition onto Meta's augmented-reality eyewear. The project, known as I-XRAY,
                            integrates with the face-recognition service Pimeyes to let Ray-Ban Meta wearers learn the
                            name of virtually anyone they see and then immediately scour databases of personal
                            information to determine other info about them, including names of family members, phone
                            numbers, and home addresses. The students say they're not releasing the code for their
                            experiment, instead intending it as a demonstration of the privacy-invasive potential of
                            augmented-reality devices. Point made. Meta Says It Will Train Its AI on Input from Smart
                            Glasses If that warning about the privacy risks of AR eyewear needed more reinforcement,
                            Meta this week also conceded to TechCrunch that it will use input from users' smart glasses
                            to train its AI products. Initially, Meta declined to answer TechCrunch's questions about
                            whether and how it would collect information from Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses for use as AI
                            training data, in contrast to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that explicitly say they
                            don't exploit user inputs to train their AI services. A couple of days later, however, Meta
                            confirmed to TechCrunch that it does in fact use images or video collected through its smart
                            glasses to train its AI, but only if the user submits them to Meta's AI tools. That means
                            anything that a user sees and asks Meta's AI chatbot to comment on or analyze will become
                            part of Meta's massive AI-training data trove. Microsoft and the DOJ Seize 100+ Domains Used
                            by Russian Spies If you can't arrest Russian hackers, at least you can nab their web
                            domains. That, at least, is the approach this week of the US Justice Department, which along
                            with Microsoft and the NGO Information Sharing and Analysis Center used a lawsuit to take
                            control of more than a hundred web domains that had been used by Russian hackers working for
                            the Kremlin's intelligence and law enforcement agency known as the FSB. Those domains had
                            been exploited in phishing campaigns by the Russian hacker group known as Star Blizzard,
                            which has a history of targeting the typical victims of geopolitical spying such as
                            journalists, think tanks, and NGOs. The domain seizures seem designed in part to head off
                            threats of foreign interference in next month's US election. “Rebuilding infrastructure
                            takes time, absorbs resources, and costs money,” Steven Masada, the assistant general
                            counsel of Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a statement. “Today’s action impacts
                            [the hackers'] operations at a critical point in time when foreign interference in US
                            democratic processes is of utmost concern.”

                            A new cryptocurrency platform. An upcoming memoir authored by his wife. A set of NFT trading
                            cards. Watches that cost as much as $100,000. With just weeks left before the November
                            election, former President Donald Trump has taken to promoting items and businesses that are
                            not at all connected to his presidential campaign. “You’re going to love them,” Trump wrote
                            on his Truth Social platform last week of his new line of branded watches, which cost
                            anywhere from $499 to $100,000. They’re being offered through a vendor that has a licensing
                            agreement with him. “Would make a great Christmas gift.” While running for president this
                            cycle, Trump has also promoted a sneaker brand, boots and even Bibles — all of which are
                            business and not campaign ventures. He has long mixed business with politics; prior to his
                            legal battles that have raged for years now, those potential conflicts of interest were the
                            subject of far greater attention. But the fact that Trump is promoting his business
                            interests again in the closing weeks of the campaign has his Democratic rivals saying it is
                            proof he is unfocused, and even some of his allies saying the effort is unwise. “I think
                            that he’s distracted,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, told NBC News. “He’s off his
                            message and he’s probably focused on what comes next after he loses the presidential race,
                            which is to continue to try to perpetuate these dicey schemes on people for his own profit.”
                            Reached for comment, a Trump campaign official said “these are all outside business
                            ventures,” adding that “no proceeds come to the campaign.” For the former president’s
                            supporters, it’s unlikely the focus on these other ventures would shift their opinion of
                            him, even though Trump was subject to some conservative backlash in 2022 when he first
                            announced an NFT line, teasing it as a “MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT” soon after he launched his
                            re-election bid. “I’m not too much worried about that,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said.
                            “Donald Trump is a businessman first, second and third. But his primary focus, purpose,
                            focus number one, two, three, four, five, is running for president and making our country
                            great again. That’s his focus.” “Everybody has things that we’re involved in personally,” he
                            added. “You have members of Congress who write books and then promote the books. So, I mean,
                            I’m not really concerned about that.” But others felt it highlighted a bigger issue with the
                            state of Trump’s candidacy, specifically that difficult conversations aren’t being had.
                            “It’s just the lack of discipline around him right now,” one Trump ally said. “There is no
                            one telling him ‘no’ very clearly. Do I think that a single Trump voter in America is not
                            voting for him because of any of this? Absolutely no. But they still haven’t [really] told
                            people [why] Kamala Harris would be a bad president. And that seems like it should probably
                            be the messaging priority.” Within the last week, Trump tweeted about how he “promised to
                            Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” in announcing that his new platform, World
                            Liberty Financial, now had a “whitelist for eligible persons” open. And ahead of the release
                            of former first lady Melania Trump’s new book, “Melania,” Trump promoted a link to her
                            website calling on supporters to “Buy your copy today.” In February, Trump attended a shoe
                            convention in Philadelphia to announce the release of a new line of Trump-branded sneakers.
                            Meanwhile, his latest financial disclosure showed that he made $300,000 off of Trump-branded
                            Bibles he promoted earlier this year. That same financial disclosure revealed he made about
                            $7.2 million from the NFTs he promoted. The Harris campaign sees Trump’s side hustles during
                            the campaign as bolstering a core part of their message about him: that he is more focused
                            on helping himself than on helping voters. “He is making the argument for our campaign,” a
                            Harris campaign official said. “And he’s making the argument to the American people of who
                            he cares about, day in and day out. And we’ll let that speak for itself.” Describing the
                            business ventures as a “grift,” the official went further, saying of Trump’s latest branded
                            merchandise: “It’s just objectively an ugly watch.” Long before he entered politics, Trump
                            had promoted similar product lines, whether Trump Steaks or Trump Vodka. Trump ended up
                            paying out a $25 million settlement to students of Trump University — the former president’s
                            real estate education venture — who said they were duped. Trump’s new watch line contributed
                            to the resurfacing of remarks Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made during a 2016 GOP primary
                            debate, during which Rubio said Trump inherited hundreds of millions of dollars and that if
                            he hadn’t, “you know where he’d be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan.” “He wants to do
                            everything and anything and throw everything against the wall,” the Trump ally said.
                            “Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it’s not. Sometimes it helps you. Sometimes we’re posting
                            NFTs or whatever.” “No one is saying, ‘Hey, sir, why don’t we not do that right now?’” this
                            person added. “And that just seems to be the only reasonable explanation for this right
                            now.”

                    Trump pitches watches, crypto and his wife's book in the campaign's final weeks
                </h3>

                            A new cryptocurrency platform. An upcoming memoir authored by his wife. A set of NFT trading
                            cards. Watches that cost as much as $100,000. With just weeks left before the November
                            election, former President Donald Trump has taken to promoting items and businesses that are
                            not at all connected to his presidential campaign. “You’re going to love them,” Trump wrote
                            on his Truth Social platform last week of his new line of branded watches, which cost
                            anywhere from $499 to $100,000. They’re being offered through a vendor that has a licensing
                            agreement with him. “Would make a great Christmas gift.” While running for president this
                            cycle, Trump has also promoted a sneaker brand, boots and even Bibles — all of which are
                            business and not campaign ventures. He has long mixed business with politics; prior to his
                            legal battles that have raged for years now, those potential conflicts of interest were the
                            subject of far greater attention. But the fact that Trump is promoting his business
                            interests again in the closing weeks of the campaign has his Democratic rivals saying it is
                            proof he is unfocused, and even some of his allies saying the effort is unwise. “I think
                            that he’s distracted,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, told NBC News. “He’s off his
                            message and he’s probably focused on what comes next after he loses the presidential race,
                            which is to continue to try to perpetuate these dicey schemes on people for his own profit.”
                            Reached for comment, a Trump campaign official said “these are all outside business
                            ventures,” adding that “no proceeds come to the campaign.” For the former president’s
                            supporters, it’s unlikely the focus on these other ventures would shift their opinion of
                            him, even though Trump was subject to some conservative backlash in 2022 when he first
                            announced an NFT line, teasing it as a “MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT” soon after he launched his
                            re-election bid. “I’m not too much worried about that,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said.
                            “Donald Trump is a businessman first, second and third. But his primary focus, purpose,
                            focus number one, two, three, four, five, is running for president and making our country
                            great again. That’s his focus.” “Everybody has things that we’re involved in personally,” he
                            added. “You have members of Congress who write books and then promote the books. So, I mean,
                            I’m not really concerned about that.” But others felt it highlighted a bigger issue with the
                            state of Trump’s candidacy, specifically that difficult conversations aren’t being had.
                            “It’s just the lack of discipline around him right now,” one Trump ally said. “There is no
                            one telling him ‘no’ very clearly. Do I think that a single Trump voter in America is not
                            voting for him because of any of this? Absolutely no. But they still haven’t [really] told
                            people [why] Kamala Harris would be a bad president. And that seems like it should probably
                            be the messaging priority.” Within the last week, Trump tweeted about how he “promised to
                            Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” in announcing that his new platform, World
                            Liberty Financial, now had a “whitelist for eligible persons” open. And ahead of the release
                            of former first lady Melania Trump’s new book, “Melania,” Trump promoted a link to her
                            website calling on supporters to “Buy your copy today.” In February, Trump attended a shoe
                            convention in Philadelphia to announce the release of a new line of Trump-branded sneakers.
                            Meanwhile, his latest financial disclosure showed that he made $300,000 off of Trump-branded
                            Bibles he promoted earlier this year. That same financial disclosure revealed he made about

                    Replace Your HVAC with BTC? These Innovators Are Doing it

                            People have gotten excited about Bitcoin for all kinds of reasons: Crypto promises to be a
                            more efficient financial ecosystem, it helps you send money abroad and it can be used as an
                            investment. But what if you could use it to offset your heating costs? Bitcoin mining is the
                            process that creates new Bitcoins — and it is done by computers performing complex
                            calculations. And, as anyone who has worked with a laptop on their lap knows, computers
                            doing complex work produce heat. Large-scale crypto mining operations often have massive
                            fans to cool their computers, but some creative thinkers are looking for ways to utilize
                            that heat instead of wasting it. Plug in a miner, cut your propane bill Zack Bomsta is a
                            former electrical engineer, founder of Owlet Baby Care and one of the founders of unbound
                            NETWORKS in Provo, Utah. He is currently running pilot programs for a plug-and-play system
                            where people can essentially have small-scale Bitcoin miners act as space heaters in their
                            homes — and save a lot of money on their heating bills. Bomsta’s company also shares some of
                            the Bitcoin mining profits with homeowners. Bomsta says that homeowners don’t need to know
                            anything about Bitcoin in order to participate. “We essentially just say, ‘Hey, if you're
                            willing to host a piece of our distributed data center, we can lower your monthly heating
                            bill by anywhere from $200 to $600 depending on your home and the market dynamics in your
                            area,’” says Bomsta. Bomsta’s team shows up with the Bitcoin miners, sets them up and plugs
                            them into the wall in different places throughout the home where they will evenly distribute
                            heat. The miners are essentially computers the size of a large air purifier and as loud as a
                            typical space heater. The technician can hook them up to Wi-Fi so you can control the
                            temperature of the room as you would with a thermostat. Where mining makes sense Bomsta’s
                            system makes the most economic sense for people who live in an area where propane is
                            expensive and electricity is cheap. The miners run on electricity, so you can expect that
                            cost to go up as your propane costs go down — but Bomsta says homeowners should still come
                            out ahead. According to Bomsta, residents in Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, North and
                            South Dakota and Montana — where one of unbound NETWORK’s pilot programs is currently
                            running — are most likely to benefit. Bomsta estimates that there are close to a million
                            homes in the U.S. that could be good candidates for this kind of system. It’s a symbiotic
                            relationship: Bomsta’s company gets space in a house and free electricity to mine Bitcoin,
                            and homeowners get heat at a reduced cost. Customers also earn a share of the Bitcoin that
                            is mined. Bomsta says that anywhere from 5% to 35% of the Bitcoin rewards generated are
                            shared with the homeowner, either in Bitcoin or transferred as dollars into the homeowner’s
                            bank account. The DIY approach While Bomsta is trying to create a plug-and-play solution,
                            others are creating systems for themselves. Cody Harris, co-founder of Citadel Construction
                            in Lander, Wyoming, and his wife are building a new home, and they decided to make a Bitcoin
                            mining system that would heat their house via radiant floor heat. Harris has no engineering
                            background, but that hasn’t stopped him from building his own setup. He learned through
                            YouTube, online forums and lots of trial and error. Similar to Bomsta’s system, Harris’
                            system is automated to turn on when the temperature drops. With a DIY system, there are two
                            important costs to consider: The cost to install it and the cost to run it. Harris says he
                            comes out ahead on both counts. He believes the total cost of parts for his system (not
                            including the radiant floor components) will be around $3,500 — similar to the price of a
                            propane boiler. The cost of running the system is a little more variable, because you have
                            to factor in the highly volatile price of Bitcoin. But for Harris, so far it has worked in
                            his favor. “Last winter, I was basically producing free power,” says Harris. “The miners
                            were producing the exact same amount of Bitcoin that it was costing me in electricity to run
                            them. So if I was spending $100 a week to heat my house, I was making $100 a week in
                            Bitcoin.” Harris' rig is a part of a larger collective of miners who share the Bitcoin
                            profits of what they mine. Savvy energy savings Building your own Bitcoin mining heater may
                            feel unapproachable, but anyone who makes the leap could help the tides turn in the
                            direction of more efficient, more resourceful heating. “It's just always going to come down
                            to who has the cheapest energy and who can be the most efficient with the use of it,” says
                            Harris. Even for someone so involved in the creation of his own setup, Harris is still
                            pretty excited by the thought of it. “Miraculously, it just works.”

                    A victim of a crypto ‘pig butchering’ scam just got his $140,000 back

                            Aleksey Madan never thought the day would come. This week he received a $140,000 check in
                            the mail from Massachusetts officials. That was the full amount Madan had lost after falling
                            for a get-rich-quick crypto scam. “How would you feel if all your money was stolen and you
                            never expected to get it back, then you did?” said Madan, 69. “It feels amazing. I’m
                            overjoyed. And also in shock.” Those funds were among the hundreds of thousands of dollars’
                            worth of cryptocurrency Massachusetts authorities seized from a fraudulent operation that
                            targeted Russian-speaking seniors online and, in some cases, stole their life savings. The
                            Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office began investigating the company, known as SpireBit,
                            followed an NPR investigation last year detailing the stories of two victims who were lured
                            into an investment scheme, only to realize it was a sham after they transferred large
                            quantities of money into SpireBit’s cryptocurrency wallets. SpireBit drew victims into its
                            ruse by using ads on social media promising lucrative investment returns. SpireBit took out
                            ads on Facebook and Instagram that falsely portrayed Elon Musk as endorsing the company
                            through a Russian voice-over. But NPR could find no trace of a real investment company: The
                            people listed as the company’s executives turned out to be just stock photos and fake
                            LinkedIn profiles. A supposed London address for SpireBit turned out to be a kitchenware
                            business. When victims tried to withdraw their money, the company sent them forged bank
                            documents. After NPR’s reporting, financial regulators in the United Kingdom issued a public
                            warning about SpireBit, classifying it as an operation run by “fraudsters.” When NPR tried
                            to reach out to SpireBit for comment last year, it responded through the Telegram messaging
                            app by stating that crypto trading is volatile, and saying "the activities of our company
                            are regulated according to the legislation of the country in which the head office of the
                            company is located." Now, that account has been deleted. NPR’s investigation caught the
                            attention of Massachusetts authorities, who in December sued SpireBit under its incorporated
                            entity known as SBT Investments. Investigators posed as a SpireBit customer and were able to
                            pinpoint crypto wallets used by SpireBit. In a judgment issued in May, state officials won a
                            court order that froze the company’s assets on the trading platform Binance. While the full
                            extent of SpireBit’s operation remains unknown, the company’s tactics are part of a
                            proliferating type of online fraud known as pig butchering. The name comes from the process
                            of gaining someone’s trust and building a friendship with them over the course of weeks or
                            months — fattening up the pig before the kill, which in this case means stealing a large sum
                            of money. According to the FBI, crypto scammers stole more than $5.6 billion from Americans
                            online last year. According to the May court order, investigators in Massachusetts were able
                            to seize a total of $269,000 from SpireBit’s crypto wallet, most of which is being
                            distributed to four victims in the state. Another SpireBit victim profiled by NPR, Naum
                            Lantsman, 75, of Los Angeles, lost his life savings of $340,000 that he earned over decades
                            as a small business owner. His family reported the theft to the California Attorney
                            General’s Office, but a formal investigation was never initiated. Officials from the
                            Massachusetts and California attorney general offices did not return interview requests.

                            CLEVELAND, Ohio – Federal prosecutors are seeking to claim $200,000 worth of cryptocurrency
                            that was siphoned from an investor in Ashtabula. Bitcoin valued at about $340,000 was
                            fraudulently transferred from the investor’s virtual currency wallet in February, according
                            to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Cleveland on Thursday. The victim did not seek
                            the transaction. Investigators analyzed a public ledger of crypto transactions to trace the
                            funds to two accounts, the documents show. Authorities found that the bitcoin from the
                            Ashtabula investor was converted to Tether, a cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar and
                            created by Tether Limited Inc. In March, a month after the theft, Tether Limited Inc. froze
                            the two accounts. Federal investigators filed a seizure warrant in July for the funds.
                            Tether Limited later transferred $200,000 worth of cryptocurrency from the two accounts to a
                            federal law enforcement fund. Authorities are seeking to return the funds to the investor,
                            though the value of the investment has dropped since the theft. Prosecutors must first go
                            through forfeiture proceedings with the owners of the two addresses. But the owners of the
                            addresses are unknown, prosecutors said in the documents. A court filing indicates that the
                            scheme originated in Nigeria. The court filings in the case say FBI agents in Cleveland are
                            “investigating cryptocurrency confidence fraud scams perpetrated on victims throughout the
                            United States, including in the Northern District of Ohio.”
