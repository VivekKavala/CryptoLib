                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Crypto venture funds are raising war chests for the next big run getty After a sluggish 2023, crypto venture capital is slowly bouncing back. As of July 2024, over $2.2 billion has been raised across 24 funds, according to data from PitchBook, putting the market on track to surpass last year’s $2.6 billion total. “We've seen an upward trend quarter over quarter for the last three,” says Robert Le, a senior analyst at PitchBook. “I still think we're somewhat in a capital-constrained environment. Typically, venture investments in crypto follow the performance of publicly traded tokens. In March of this year, the market recovered to 93% of its previous cycle’s peak in total market cap. However, we’re still far from seeing the same level of venture capital investment as before, particularly the $30 billion raised in the last cycle. Many investors felt burned by the failures and losses in that period, so they’re much more cautious about deploying capital now." Crypto venture fundraising peaked in 2022 before a major collapse in 2023. Pitchbook Macroeconomic challenges such as inflation and rising interest rates have curbed investments in riskier assets like crypto. But, according to Banafsheh Fathieh, co-founder and general partner at Lightspeed Faction (Faction collaborates with Lightspeed Venture Partners Faction, but operates its $285 million fund independently), the crypto industry has undergone a necessary correction. With the excesses of the last bull run behind them, investors are returning, albeit cautiously. Fathieh highlights that early-stage investments—now accounting for roughly 80% of activity—are seeing renewed interest. The exuberance of 2021, she adds, created market distortions, but the current environment reflects a healthier and more deliberate approach to growth and innovation. Key Narratives As the market recalibrates, investors are eyeing specific sectors poised for growth. Infrastructure, particularly within the Solana ecosystem, is seeing renewed interest. "Solana is taking market share from Ethereum and others,” says Matthew Graham, founder and managing partner at Ryze Labs (formerly Sino Global Capital). "We’re going to see more consumer-facing apps with real product-market fit emerge, and Solana’s technology is well-positioned to support that shift." Graham emphasizes the potential in consumer applications that fuse gaming with practical utility, citing examples like fitness apps such as STEPN. However, he warns that investors be mindful of the source of revenues. Whether returns are generated through tokens, equity, or hybrid models, understanding the nuances of these financial structures is critical for long-term success. Venture capitalists are also excited about DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) that coordinate machines and devices like Helium, a blockchain-based wireless network; Hivemapper, a decentralized mapping network that aggregates road-level imagery and data; and GEODNET, a blockchain-based project focused on improving location data accuracy. “All of those guys have started to show some ability to go to market on demand. We need to see that continue to grow,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly Capital. The potential of decentralized AI is also drawing attention. While some speculate on decentralized networks replacing cloud giants like AWS or Azure, Fanizadeh is more cautious: “To be candid, I don't think that will happen, but there are a few places where crypto is not an optional piece of technology but a critical piece.” AI developers often cite access to computing power as their primary hurdle. Fanizadeh points to innovations like decentralized GPU marketplaces, which allow idle computing resources to be pooled for AI workloads (one example is Lightspeed Faction’s portfolio company Hyperbolic Labs). Another area “where crypto becomes quite interesting is where cryptography enables a verification layer where it can ensure things like data integrity, model integrity. That can create sort of a verification and authentication mechanism for everything that really feeds in into AI” (Faction’s verification-focused plays include Nexus and Space and Time). Rethinking Late-Stage Investments Late-stage investments, which saw inflated valuations during the last bull run, have been subject to greater scrutiny. “There’s been a recommitment to being more thoughtful about how much and at what price to put capital into,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “While seed-stage valuations have remained somewhat elevated, later-stage unicorns have traded at steep discounts. For non-token equity businesses, we’re seeing 60% discounts, maybe even lower, depending on the company. We've seen Chainalysis [blockchain intelligence firm], Fireblocks [custodian and blockchain infrastructure provider] trade at 70% discounts. For some, like OpenSea [an NFT marketplace, threatened to be sued by the SEC], there’s something like a 90% discount.” Despite these markdowns, Fanizadeh believes that quality companies will rebound as the economic environment shifts. “Even if you have a contraction on the multiple side, if they are good businesses—and many of them are—they’ll have some time to recover,” she says. “As the interest rate environment changes, you’ll start to see the equity side return to more normalized multiples.” In the meantime, investors are focusing more heavily on seed-stage opportunities, where the potential for growth—and risk—is more palpable. What’s Next? PitchBook’s Le predicts an influx of first-time fund managers. "Over the next year or two, we’re going to see many of these new funds come to market, marking a new cycle of innovation," he says. The emphasis will be on sustainable, long-term growth rather than short-term hype. The cyclical nature of the crypto market, as tracked by PitchBook, often mirrors bitcoin’s halving events, which cut the rewards for mining bitcoin by half. Historically, peaks in crypto fundraising have aligned with these cycles, with notable surges in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Writes Le “If these historical trends continue, we anticipate another fundraising peak in 2026, aligning with the next expected major cycle in the crypto market.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
