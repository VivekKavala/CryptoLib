                    About 85 pc of world’s cryptocurrencies are not even worth a cent: Report
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            New Delhi, Oct 7 (IANS) About 85 per cent of the world’s cryptocurrencies are even worth
                            less than one cent, according to a report on Monday.

                            The total number of cryptocurrencies has been floating between 8,500 and 10,000, with new
                            tokens being launched every time a bull run in the crypto space begins.

                            Currently, the total number of cryptocurrencies remains at a high of 9,861. However, most of
                            them have little or practically no value.

                            As per data analysis by AltIndex.com, 85 per cent of all cryptocurrencies circulating in the
                            market are worth less than one cent.

                            It also showed 9,525, or 96 per cent of all coins circulating in the crypto space, are worth
                            less than a dollar.

                            Just 131 coins were valued between 50 cents and one US dollar (as of last week), the report
                            mentioned.

                            “Around 400 had a price tag between 50 and 10 cents, and another 548 were valued between one
                            and 10 cents. That means a shocking 8,443 coins, or 85 per cent of all cryptocurrencies, are
                            worth less than a cent,” the analysis revealed.

                            Several such crypto tokens were launched during the cryptocurrency boom. Due to a rise of
                            blockchain technology, anyone can launch a new cryptocurrency.

                            As per CoinMarketCap data, top five cryptocurrencies now make up 82 per cent of the total
                            crypto market cap, with a combined value of $1.78 trillion.

                            Bitcoin accounts for 56 per cent of the global crypto market cap, up from 48 per cent a year
                            ago. Ethereum makes roughly 12 per cent of the total crypto market cap, 7 per cent less than
                            last year.

                            On Monday, Bitcoin price was hovering around $62,800, up 1.5 per cent. Ethereum was also up
                            1.3 per cent at nearly $2,450, according to latest data from CoinGecko.

                            The buzz around cryptocurrencies is back with Bitcoin

                            prices getting a boost this year and investors and the media renewing their interest. To a
                            retail investor though, the question of particular interest is: What has changed
                            fundamentally in the cryptocurrency arena to help Bitcoin prices swell more than 120% in the
                            last twelve months?

                            The Bitcoin growth story does not end here. There is growing chatter about Bitcoin
                            potentially breaching the $100K mark. Which, given the current price around $61,000, that
                            would be a move of over 60% over several years. What remains to be seen is whether this
                            story plays out the same way oil prices did during the 2008-09 financial crisis (the number
                            100 does tend to spook investors), or if the Bitcoin story has an altogether different
                            ending.

                            The Bigger Picture

                            In general, investment assets are difficult to price using static demand-supply models. This
                            is particularly true for cryptocurrencies. But, as in the case of any investment asset,
                            expectations about demand and supply positions could help point in the general direction.
                            Notably, Bitcoin prices over the years have primarily been driven by the perception of how a
                            particular piece of news boosts or hurts the potential number of Bitcoin users and their
                            transaction volume in the long run.

                            In this context, Bitcoin’s demand position is primarily driven by two factors:

                            the number of active users

                            how much they transact.

                            On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and almost 94% of the capped
                            number is already mined. With limited supply side upside, it is sensible to focus on the
                            demand - both in terms of users and transaction volumes.

                            Have any of the demand side factors really changed?

                            picture for crypto demand over the long term.

                            The World’s Best Tequila—According To The 2024 San Francisco World Spirit Competition

                            The first factor is the renewed belief that Bitcoins are a real substitute for the US dollar
                            as a dependable exchange currency as well as asset class - especially with the uncertainties
                            and doomsday stories surrounding the strength of the US dollar.

                            Renewed support of the political class is a close second factor, with both Trump and Harris
                            coming out openly in support of new technologies and digital assets. This strengthens the
                            belief that US government policies are likely to remain favorable for Bitcoins and other
                            cryptocurrencies going forward. In fact, over the last few years, adverse government actions
                            and statements were key constraining factors in the movement of crypto prices. Additionally,
                            it seems that major economies around the globe are slowly coming to terms with the crypto
                            movement as there has not been any major adverse policy action in the recent past.

                            The third factor is the risk psychology of retail investors who find comfort in a new asset
                            class when larger institutional investors take positions in it. In this aspect, the
                            introduction of Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is believed to have been a game changer with
                            the fund being one of the fastest growing ETFs in the last few months. This has helped
                            retain investor perception in 2 key ways:

                            it multiplies investor confidence on Bitcoins as a long-term asset

                            it indicates the increasing number of open positions and active users of Bitcoin - both
                            strong demand side positives.

                            Does Bitcoin look attractive now?

                            Overall, the performance of Bitcoin over the years has been extremely volatile. Returns for
                            the asset were 60% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 155% in 2023. In fact, consistent returns - in
                            good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for any single asset class. In
                            contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has
                            outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ
                            Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of
                            a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

                            Given the current demand-supply dynamics, could Bitcoin be relegated to being a promising
                            but underperforming asset class over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump to
                            scale $100K?

                            Why the $100K mark is of interest

                            Interest on Bitcoin options at around the strike rate of $100K has been enormous as
                            indicated by the jump in open interest at this strike. Any position is a two-way traffic
                            where someone is willing to sell and someone is willing to buy. But increasing strike
                            positions definitely signals an upward momentum.

                            Some of the positions are bound to be speculative in nature and such speculations would keep
                            Bitcoin prices volatile and risky for short term investments. However, if the demand for
                            Bitcoin holds up, it is a matter of time before Bitcoin prices cross the $100K barrier.

                            The following month, Triefus left Gucci “abruptly,” according to Vogue Business. He was off
                            “to pursue other opportunities,” the brand said at the time. A month later, Vogue Business
                            revealed that Triefus was to be the new Stone Island CEO. Immediately there was speculation
                            on whether Stone Island would enter the metaverse. So far it has not.
                            Triefus’ public zeal for all things virtual and his short-lived tenure as the head of
                            Gucci’s metaverse strategy are both part of a broader trend that briefly convulsed the
                            private sector starting in late 2021: the hastily recruited “chief metaverse officer.”
                            Following a wave of excitement around the metaverse as a golden new opportunity for
                            commerce, a legion of brands rushed to launch their own virtual storefronts. Three quarters
                            of CEOs surveyed by Russell Reynolds in 2022 said they were hiring dedicated talent to lead
                            in the space, or expanding current roles to cover it.
                            While the actual titles varied, their main role seemed to involve helping their respective
                            brands devise new strategies with then-buzzy technologies such as NFTs and crypto. However,
                            the fact that there wasn’t much consensus around the definition of the metaverse only made
                            for further inconsistency between job descriptions and what exactly these roles were meant
                            to do.
                            Boom and Bust
                            This all started, of course, in October 2021, when Facebook changed its name to Meta,
                            signaling its new focus on the metaverse. CEO Mark Zuckerberg painted a picture of a vast
                            and hugely profitable virtual frontier, where future generations would work, play, hang out,
                            date, and (crucially) shop. Reality Labs, the company’s virtual reality (VR) division,
                            backed up that belief with cold hard cash, spending $13.7 billion in 2022 alone—a figure
                            higher than the GDP of Mongolia.
                            Brands leapt at the opportunity to sell a whole new category of virtual goods and
                            experiences, tantalized by the notion that consumers were lining up to attend VR concerts
                            and buy NFT sneakers.
                            “Many brands were quick to experiment—there was a sense of a land grab,” says Matthew Ball,
                            a tech investor and the author of The Metaverse. “They didn't want to be last, and they were
                            excited to try and be first … They also saw the opportunity to do something that is actually
                            very unusual for a brand, which is to be part of a social experience.”
                            Luxury brands were particularly keen, having been slow on the uptake with the early days of
                            ecommerce. It also felt like the perfect overlap, as the twin Web3 ethos of exclusivity and
                            authenticity meshed nicely with their industry’s allure. And, for a moment, it seemed to be
                            working.
                            Gucci, the first luxury brand to purchase digital real estate in the Sandbox, famously sold
                            a virtual version of its Dionysus handbag on Roblox for about $4,100—$800 more than the
                            price of its physical counterpart. Jeweler Tiffany & Co launched virtual necklaces modeled
                            after the CryptoPunks NFT series (“NFTiffs”), which initially sold for around $50,000
                            apiece, earning the company more than $12 million. And Burberry launched a two-pronged
                            attack, offering digital branded skins on Minecraft and a capsule collection inspired by the
                            game in real life, netting an estimated £5.2 million ($6.8 million) return on investment in
                            advertising.
                            Law firms even started setting up in the space—no doubt sparked by Hermès suing an NFT
                            creator for selling 100 “MetaBirkin” NFTs based on the brand's famous Birkin bag. Reflecting
                            this wave of excitement, McKinsey published a report in April 2022 estimating that the
                            metaverse would be valued at $5 trillion by 2030.
                            Then, as quickly as it had materialized, the excitement dissipated. Like Dorothy peering
                            behind the curtain and finding the Wizard of Oz to be no more than a diminutive man pulling
                            levers, the world seemed to have looked into the metaverse and found … not much at all.
                            Horizon Worlds—Meta’s flagship VR platform—was a virtual ghost town populated by legless
                            virtual avatars. In late 2022, data aggregator DappRadar found that Decentraland—a virtual
                            “sandbox” where users can buy and sell virtual real estate—had just 38 active users over a
                            single 24-hour period. Let’s say that again: Just 38. The company’s market cap at the time
                            was around $1.3 billion.
                            It was around that time that Meta—along with most other big players in Silicon
                            Valley—pivoted much of its capital and PR muscle to AI in a panic, following the surprise
                            release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Brands that not so long ago had thrown themselves
                            wholeheartedly into the metaverse soon began to follow suit.
                            It would be surprising if it wasn’t all so incredibly familiar. Back in 2007, Second Life,
                            an open-world online game in which users interact as pseudonymous avatars, was experiencing
                            a period of explosive growth, grabbing the attention of companies who were keen to
                            capitalize on it. With very little understanding of the platform, or knowledge of the users
                            within it, companies including IBM, Cisco and Microsoft spent huge amounts on Second Life
                            “islands” to have a presence in this bright new world. But by 2010, brands were already
                            backing out, calling it a “costly mistake.”
                            Second Life founder Philip Rosedale says companies falsely believed that these virtual
                            worlds would attract a representative sample of their target audiences, when current
                            open-world online games like Fortnite and Roblox are being played overwhelmingly by kids.
                            "You don't know if you can sell things to the people that are in a certain virtual world
                            unless you can presume that they're a cross-section of regular people," Rosedale says. “You
                            need normal people that you're selling stuff to, and that is what has absolutely, 100
                            percent not happened in Second Life or Horizon Worlds or VR Chat, or any of the other
                            platforms.”
                            Ball adds that the speed at which brands wanted to act, without a real plan or understanding
                            of the space, created issues for its longevity: “There was definitely a lot of, ‘We need to
                            do this because everyone's doing it,’ and ‘We need to do this because shareholders expect us
                            to be doing it.’ There were many that overestimated the relevance of their brand in these 3D
                            spaces.”
                            A Pivot to AI
                            Now, many of the chief metaverse officers, who had been so quickly installed, scrambled to
                            reinvent themselves—or otherwise found themselves out of a job entirely. Coca-Cola’s Pratik
                            Thakar swiftly pivoted from spearheading the brand’s metaverse content to becoming the
                            company’s global generative AI lead in August 2023.
                            Around the same time, Michael White, who was tasked to lead Disney’s metaverse efforts in
                            2022, left after the brand's dedicated metaverse division was closed down; the company
                            announced it was launching a new AI “task force” just days later. Then, in the wake of
                            Triefus’ departure from Gucci, the brand promoted a collaboration with Christie’s on its
                            first generative AI project.
                            In case any further proof was needed that the shift from the metaverse to AI was complete,
                            in the last quarter of 2022, Bloomberg transcript data recorded just two mentions of the
                            metaverse in earnings calls at S&P 500 businesses. In the first quarter of 2023, AI had
                            racked up 1,073.
                            According to Cathy Hackl, formerly the chief metaverse officer for a consulting firm called
                            Journey, the broad-scale marketing shift from virtual brand experiences to AI was both a
                            savvy business decision and just another example of technological bandwagon-jumping.
                            Today, Hackl reflects on the metaverse land grab as a phenomenon that quickly escalated out
                            of control. “There was this rush among PR teams to get anything 'metaverse' out there,” she
                            says. “I think we'll look back at it as a really interesting moment in time, but maybe we
                            all got ahead of our skis a little bit."
                            Don’t Mention the “M” Word
                            Even Hackl, who was given the nickname “Godmother of the Metaverse,” has been distancing
                            herself from the concept, founding “a spatial computing and AI solutions company” earlier
                            this year, with any mention of metaverse notable in its absence.
                            The metaverse-focused initiatives that once seemed to be a part of every launch are also
                            suspiciously quiet. Bulgari, which launched an NFT jewelry collection on Polygon’s
                            blockchain in 2022, confirmed to WIRED that it has no plans for any further collections in
                            the future.
                            UNXD, a “curated NFT marketplace,” with partners including Dolce & Gabbana, Jacob & Co., and
                            Valentino, is still advertising a competition for Metaverse Fashion Week 2023, along with a
                            number of “to be announced” collections that had been confirmed for launch in 2022.
                            The buzz on collections that were initially successful has all but died too—Tiffany NFTiffs
                            now sell for around $2,300 on NFT marketplace OpenSea, a drop of more than 95 percent from
                            peak selling prices, while the activity on Gucci’s “Superplastic” NFT series on OpenSea
                            shows a staggering drop in sales interest from around September 2022, and now—virtually
                            nothing.
                            Why this has happened is up for debate. From the lack of an audience, to the clunky,
                            uncomfortable, and prohibitively expensive VR hardware, or the lack of interoperability, the
                            promise of the metaverse from 2021 simply isn’t holding true in 2024. And Zuckerberg knows
                            it: He mentioned the word just three times in his hour-long keynote address at his company’s
                            developer conference, Meta Connect—despite the fact it’s his company’s namesake.
                            Not everyone has given up on the idea, though. A quick scan of LinkedIn shows chief
                            metaverse officers are, amazingly, still in place at some companies, though those job roles
                            are now usually lumped in with any number of emerging digital innovations. Nelly Mensah at
                            LVMH is one of them, with references to her job title subtly shifting to “VP of Digital
                            Innovation” as interest in the metaverse wanes. In keeping with the trends of the industry,
                            the most recent digital experience from the company leaned heavily on Generative AI, with no
                            mention of the “m” word to be seen anywhere.
                            This fall from grace was anticipated by Matthew Ball in a footnote at the end of his book,
                            predicting that by the time the underlying concept finally arrives, we’ll call it by a
                            different name. And right on cue, augmented reality arrived to pick up where the metaverse
                            left off.
                            Repositioning a Concept
                            With the VR-focused metaverse clearly not clicking with the mainstream, many tech brands
                            have begun to lean into AR in the hope that sticks. So far, it's looking promising. Meta
                            unveiled its Smart Glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban last year, and it teased the first
                            real prototype of its “true augmented reality glasses” at Meta Connect; Apple has made much
                            of the Vision Pro's ability to let the user toggle between pass-through AR and VR; Snap just
                            released the latest iteration of its AI Spectacles in September, exclusively to AR Lens
                            developers; and we're all waiting to see the final version of Google's new AR glasses it
                            couldn't help but tease back in May.
                            Meanwhile, “phygital” has cropped up as a new marketing buzzword, referring to a supposedly
                            growing demand among consumers to blend physical and online experiences. So, with perhaps
                            almost depressing inevitability, another LinkedIn search shows this phrase now increasingly
                            appearing in job titles where once the M-word loomed large.
                            According to Shara Senderoff, founder of virtual design studio Futureverse, the tech world’s
                            pivot to AR is an attempt to backpedal to a form of virtual experience that will be more
                            palatable to the average consumer.
                            “We skipped a step,” she says. “We went from nothing to 6-lb [VR] headsets. That’s never
                            going to be comfortable, literally and figuratively. Now you’re seeing Snapchat and Meta
                            lighten the load to onboard people into an experience that’s more accessible.”
                            Perhaps finally realizing that, like the poor folks in Decentraland (and possibly Apple's
                            Vision Pro team), no one wants to live inside a computer, Zuckerberg seems to have performed
                            a kind of marketing sleight-of-hand, repositioning the metaverse from a fully immersive,
                            virtual experience to one that can be accessed through the company’s AR-powered smart
                            glasses. An experience which he hopes that, unlike VR, will be a mainstream hit.
                            The company’s advances in AR, he said during the Meta Connect Keynote, “are getting closer
                            to achieving the dream of Reality Labs … This is where we are going.” Then again, he’s
                            invested far too much to be able to afford saying anything else.

                    Satoshi Nakamoto Trends – Len Sassaman Leads $4.6M Polymarket Bet For HBO's Bitcoin Creator Reveal
                </h3>

                            Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, was trending on X early Monday as the
                            cryptocurrency world awaits HBO's documentary film that claims to have unmasked the creator
                            of the world's first decentralized digital currency.Many crypto users are looking forward to
                            the docu-film's release on Tuesday, Oct. 8 on HBO Max. As the Bitcoin community discussed
                            the upcoming film and its anticipated reveal of the person or entity behind Satoshi
                            Nakamoto, Polymarket capitalized on the excitement.HBO Teases Unmasking of the Real
                            SatoshiHBO released a trailer for the documentary last week, gaining over a million views in
                            a few days. "Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, could be one of the richest people
                            on Earth. But many years ago, Satoshi had disappeared, and with Bitcoin being woven into the
                            fabric of the financial system, solidifying its role as digital gold, perhaps the question
                            of Satoshi's identity was more pressing than ever," a voice over in the trailer says.Many
                            theories have emerged regarding who the real Satoshi Nakamoto is. Controversial political
                            commentator Tucker Carlson was among those who said Satoshi is actually the CIA.On
                            decentralized market prediction platform Polymarket, crypto bettors managed to pour over
                            $4.6 million so far into an event contract that asked who the HBO documentary will identify
                            as the BTC creator.Len Sassaman in the LeadAs of early Monday, 40.5% of the bets are on
                            American computer systems engineer Len Sassaman, who was known for being a wunderkind in
                            cryptography.Sassman is best known for his privacy advocacy, as well as a trove of
                            publications and conference presentations – many of them were on financial cryptography.
                            Notably, after he died by suicide on July 3, 2011, a memorial was encoded into block 138735
                            on the Bitcoin blockchain. "Len was our friend. A brilliant mind, a kind soul, and a devious
                            schemer," the tribute reads.Meredith L. Patterson, Sassaman's wife, said that "to the best
                            of my knowledge, Len was not Satoshi." Despite Patterson's clarification, it appears many
                            Bitcoiners still believe Sassaman is the real Satoshi.Alex Thorn of Galaxy Digital has also
                            said he was hearing the HBO documentary will reveal Sassaman as Satoshi Nakamoto.For
                            @cryptosimbiiote, the most striking "piece of evidence" linking Sassaman to Satoshi is "that
                            Nakamoto went silent two months before Sasssman's death." Nakamoto's last communication
                            revealed that he/they "moved on to other things."Cryptosimbiiote, a well-followed figure in
                            the crypto space, went on to note that Sassaman's suicide note "consisted of 24 random
                            words, which obviously bears a strong resemblance to the 24-word seed phrases used in
                            cryptocurrency wallets."Hal Finney Also a Strong Contender?Finney, an American software
                            developer, was the first person to ever receive Bitcoin from Satoshi. The transaction was
                            completed on Jan. 12, 2009, wherein Finney received 10 BTC. He is also among the figures
                            being touted as the potential real Satoshi on Polymarket.Finney is widely recognized in the
                            Bitcoin community for being an early adopter, a veteran in BTC mining, and his statements
                            regarding the cryptocurrency's potential and eventual meteoric rise.Other notable names
                            Polymarket bettors are putting their money on for the event contract are Blockstream CEO
                            Adam Back, and even international drug dealer Paul Le Roux.Among the people who made it to
                            the list and are getting some of the bets, Sassaman and Finney are the closest so far in
                            terms of links and ties to Bitcoin and Satoshi. It remains to be seen whether HBO will
                            provide conclusive evidence on the person it will identify as the creator of now the largest
                            digital asset by market value.

                            With the many offers and services of banks worldwide, one would think that there are only a
                            few unbanked individuals, especially as the technological age challenges old practices in
                            the financial system.However, the World Bank's latest estimates revealed that there are
                            still around 1.4 billion unbanked people around the world, unveiling the persisting barriers
                            that many people still face even with the expansion of some of the world's largest
                            banks.Neobanks, digital-only platforms that provide various services such as online banking,
                            enter the picture with offerings that consumers can access through their smartphones with
                            lower fees and requiring minimal documentation and verification for basic services.In an
                            exclusive with International Business Times, digital marketing and blockchain pioneer Reeve
                            Collins, who is also the co-founder of on-chain neobanking platform WeFi, shared his
                            thoughts on the rise of the emerging segment and how it has been changing the financial
                            landscape with a focus on broader inclusivity.Breaking the Barriers for Unbanked
                            ConsumersTraditional banking solutions are known to come with barriers that prevent many
                            consumers, especially in emerging economies, from engaging with finance. Among the main
                            hurdles are strict documentation requirements, high fees, and a lack of physical facilities
                            in remote areas.With neobanks, the entry process is simplified, allowing consumers all
                            around the world to now be part of the vast financial world. "If you look at the standard
                            KYC (know-your customer) verification processes within neobanks today, users just need to
                            take a picture of their ID and a selfie," Collins said."This ease of access empowers
                            unbanked individuals to safely store money, make transactions, and participate in the
                            broader economy," he added.The Regions That Will Benefit the Most from NeobankingThere is no
                            doubt many western countries boast of banked populations. However, parts of Africa, many in
                            Southeast Asia, Latin America, parts of the Middle East, and some areas in eastern Europe,
                            have yet to indulge in the banking experience.A Statista Research report in 2023 revealed
                            that in Southeast Asia, many of the unbanked populations were located in Vietnam and the
                            Philippines. In Africa, Morocco posted the highest numbers of unbanked populations.There is
                            a significant disconnect in basic financial services in some areas, even in countries where
                            smartphone and internet usage is incredibly high, such as in Africa."Neobanks can leverage
                            this widespread mobile connectivity to offer banking services directly through smartphones,
                            bypassing the need for physical branches, making it easier for consumers to open accounts,
                            transfer money, and access credit," Collins noted.In the Latin American region where some
                            countries such as Argentina and Venezuela are grappling with inflation and economic
                            instability, consumers are searching for ways to save on financial transaction fees while
                            protecting their savings and investing in new financial products that stand as a hedge
                            against inflation."Neobanks, especially those that integrate cryptocurrencies like we're
                            doing at WeFi, can provide a secure platform for these needs. They offer an alternative to
                            traditional banking systems that might not be meeting people's needs effectively," Collins
                            said.The Case of Trust and Other Barriers for Broader AdoptionThe Statista report
                            underscored how unbanked individuals are generally found in "countries where citizens have
                            little trust in the banking system." Building trust with consumers is not an easy task, even
                            for neobanks, especially with persisting cyberattacks on digital platforms.Collins
                            acknowledged that neobanking service providers will need to convince consumers that their
                            digital-only platforms are worthy of trust. The way forward is through demonstrating strong
                            security measures and reliability.He also pointed out how regulatory compliance is a key
                            challenge for neobanks. Traditional banking is a heavily regulated industry, and rules vary
                            in certain jurisdictions. Navigating through the regulations can be difficult for neobanks,
                            especially those looking to operate across multiple regions.Beyond the internal barriers
                            that neobanks may face, there's also the issue on financial literacy. Older generations may
                            not be comfortable with digital interfaces, and people in areas where there is limited
                            education on digital services may be hesitant to adopt the new technology. "Without proper
                            guidance and user-friendly designs, neobanks may struggle to attract these users," Collins
                            said.What Can Neobanks Do to Trigger a Sure Revolution?Neobanks are already reshaping the
                            financial realm and doing what traditional banks have struggled to accomplish over the
                            years: catering to the unbanked. On the other hand, there has yet to be a significant shift.
                            To trigger a revolution similar to how Bitcoin has changed the game for holders when it
                            first entered the financial space, there are several measures neobanks may want to
                            consider.For Collins, neobanks should attempt what many firms in emerging digital finance
                            segments may be struggling with: viewing regulatory compliance with a fresh
                            approach."Traditional compliance methods can be complex and often create friction for users.
                            Neobanks should explore new compliance models and next-gen solutions like AI-driven
                            compliance systems that can streamline processes without sacrificing security. At WeFi,
                            we're exploring how AI can automate compliance tasks, making them more efficient while
                            enhancing security measures," Collins revealed.Reaching the unbanked is still a challenge
                            for neobanks, especially people without formal identification documents. Collins believes
                            neobanking providers should move beyond ID-based verification and consider behavior-based
                            methods. "By analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns, we can build secure profiles
                            that allow more people to access banking services without the usual barriers," he said.Trust
                            is a key gauge for consumers looking into exploring new finance-related offerings. Neobanks
                            should prioritize security and transparency in this regard, Collins said. Measures include
                            implementing robust security protocols and being upfront about how user data is handled.
                            Leveraging blockchain technology can be highly beneficial in this aspect.Finally, neobanks
                            should look into appealing services that go beyond basic transactions. Neobanking platforms
                            should consider loans, investment options, and financial educational tools.Neobanks Will Be
                            the NormCollins sees a future where neobanks will no longer just be an emerging segment but
                            "the norm in digital finances." In the next decade, he is expecting AI to play a crucial
                            role in driving neobanks forward through smarter budgeting tools, personalized financial
                            advice, and proactive fraud detection.He also believes accessibility will improve
                            "dramatically" as neobanking breaks down the barriers for inclusivity by adopting more
                            advanced user verification methods. "Regulatory landscapes will also adapt," he projected,
                            as governments and financial authorities begin to collaborate with fintech and blockchain
                            firms.A massive change Collins expects for the next 10 years is the "full integration of
                            cryptocurrencies and digital assets into everyday banking." Neobanks will bridge the gap
                            between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) as blockchain goes
                            mainstream.WeFi is leading the revolution. It is taking a step further by integrating
                            blockchain technology into its neobank platform to provide low-cost remittance services.
                            WeFi also offers digital currency access. Users can hold, transfer or invest in crypto, and
                            in the future, users may be able to access tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as well.Amid
                            the evolution, "user empowerment will be at the forefront," Collins predicted. With neobanks
                            providing the tools that give people greater control over their finances, the future is
                            bright, especially for the once-unbanked population.

                    Cardano primed for epic comeback as whales bet big on 2x LTC & DTX Exchange Moonshot rally 
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The sudden inflows in the crypto sector, notably in Bitcoin and Ethereum, revived investors’
                            hopes globally. Many analysts predict a bullish reversal in October, and any potential
                            sentiment changes keep the whales on the edge of their chairs. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) and
                            Litecoin (LTC) are labelled prime cryptos to moonshot as the month proceeds.

                            Similarly, DTX Exchange (DTX) is another emerging crypto standing in line with Cardano (ADA)
                            and Litecoin (LTC) for a bullish revival, following key developments and surging global
                            interest. In this article, we’ll see how these three cryptos can surge past critical
                            threshold levels and what developments lead to a pump in whale activity.

                            Midnight Protocol launch sparks demand for Cardano (ADA)

                            Cardano (ADA) closed the last month on a bullish note. However, the price has reversed back
                            to the lower support range. Investors took this setback optimistically after Cardano (ADA)
                            announced the testnet launch of Midnight Protocol for developers as a major factor in
                            pumping the price of ADA tokens above $0.4.

                            Moreover, the buy-the-dip opportunity and the 18.53M token unlock on October 2 can raise the
                            Cardano (ADA) price once the volatility settles. Experts are positive about Cardano (ADA) in
                            October, predicting that ADA will break the immediate thresholds following surging
                            developmental activities, settling around $0.5 if the bullish pressures persist.

                            Litecoin (LTC) poised to hit $100 after MoneyGram collaboration

                            Litecoin (LTC) is trading in the red after a bearish market pulled the altcoins down to
                            September lows. However, the recent collaboration of Litecoin (LTC) with MoneyGram has
                            multi-folded its scalability and increased its prominence as it allows users in the United
                            States to trade, hold, and sell LTC tokens with a mobile app.

                            Following a parabolic surge in its active addresses and whale activity, Litecoin (LTC) is
                            set for a bullish 2x rally by mid-October once the market momentum shifts. This bull run can
                            push the ‘Digital Silver’ Litecoin (LTC) to its former glory at $100 and experts are
                            optimistic about this event through technical analysis and market activity.

                            DTX Exchange (DTX) presale hits $3.5M: Launch rally on horizon

                            DTX Exchange (DTX) is on the road to becoming the biggest and most relevant advanced trading
                            platform for users globally through its 1000x leverage, hybrid model, AI-backed schemas, and
                            the availability of stocks, cryptos, forex, equities, and CFDs on a single platform. This
                            all-in-one platform has raised the bar after grabbing a staggering $3.5M in batch 3 of the
                            public presale.

                            This bullish momentum is leading DTX Exchange to near its mainnet launch, which is planned
                            for the end of 2024. Priced at $0.06, DTX tokens exponentially increase their value with
                            each presale stage as predictions suggest that they will break past the $1 level once they
                            start getting listed on major CEX platforms, promising a 5x rally for early investors.

                            DTX revolutionary features drive whale activity in presale

                            DTX Exchange (DTX) serves as the go-to platform for seasonal and new traders as the
                            end-to-end solution provider from asset management to buying with automation and real-time
                            analytics and from executing transactions over its first-ever hybrid blockchain to earn
                            passive income strategies through liquidity pools and its VIP Rebate Program.

                            The DTX platform eliminates gas fees and offers lightning-fast execution alongside
                            governance rights and access to mega airdrops. The KYC-free onboarding and non-custodial
                            wallets are a major addition for data-conscious users. Overall, DTX Exchange (DTX) comes
                            with an all-in-one package and includes the best features of CEX and DEX platforms, being
                            profitable and highly accessible for broader communities of traders.

                            Key takeaways

                            As market volatility lingers amid market downside, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) gear up
                            for 2x rallies. On top of them is DTX Exchange, which has had presale success and bullish
                            gains as it heads toward the mainnet launch in 2024. The combination of technical
                            advancements and growing market interest positions these cryptos as prime candidates for a
                            bullish revival in October’s expected bull run.

                            Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer announced there was an "isolated" exploit of an
                            investor's token transfer, resulting in the loss of over 1.6 million EIGEN tokens worth some
                            $5.5 million.The protocol's statement came after traders raised issue with the sale of $5.5
                            million in EIGEN Friday, with some saying the sale may have violated the token lockup period
                            as the digital coins were sold less than a year since the airdrop date. EIGEN tokens were
                            air-dropped on May 10.An Erroneous Transfer of Investor TokensOn Saturday, EigenLayer said
                            it was looking into the "unapproved selling activity" of a specific wallet. Later in the
                            day, the protocol confirmed there had been an "isolated incident" of a malicious attacker
                            compromising "one investor's transfer of tokens into custody.""As a result, 1,673,645 EIGEN
                            tokens were erroneously transferred to the attacker's address," the team behind the protocol
                            said. They added that the attacker has since sold the tokens through a decentralized swap
                            platform and moved stablecoins to centralized exchanges.Some of the funds have been frozen
                            and EigenLayer is communicating with the platforms that the exploiter engaged with, as well
                            as law enforcement.The team clarified that there was no impact on the broader ecosystem, but
                            users have raised concerns over the development.Crypto Users Raise Doubt Over TransfersSome
                            cryptocurrency users on X doubt that the incident was from a malicious attacker. Instead,
                            some suggested that it could have been an "insider" job. One user went as far as accusing
                            the protocol's developer of being the one who could have messed with the transfer and then

                            figures are much smaller than the losses in August, which reached $316 million, and losses
                            in July, which were at nearly $300 million. Among the top incidents last month, as per
                            SlowMist, were contract vulnerabilities, private key leaks, and account breaches.

                    The ‘Crypto Punks’ Behind Trump’s Murky New Business Venture

                            Chase Herro is an online salesman who proudly calls himself a “dirtbag of the internet,”
                            able to sell anything to anyone. Zachary Folkman ran a company called Date Hotter Girls,
                            offering advice under a pseudonym on how to pick up women at bars.

                            For the past decade or so, the two men have been serial entrepreneurs, leaving behind a
                            trail of lawsuits and unpaid debt and taxes.

                            Now they are former President Donald J. Trump’s business partners.

                            Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman are the forces behind World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency
                            venture that Mr. Trump and his three sons announced on a livestream last month. The
                            Republican presidential candidate declared his new enterprise would help turn the United
                            States into “the crypto capital of the world.”

                            His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman would help engineer a
                            financial revolution based on digital dollars. “You could put them in a boardroom at Goldman
                            Sachs, and they’re going to smoke the people in the room,” he said.

                    Bitcoin and Ether ETFs helped take crypto mainstream. Are Solana and XRP next?
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds
                            (ETFs) at the start of this year, capturing the attention of investors. The influx of
                            capital into these funds fueled a rapid rise in bitcoin’s value, which soon reached an
                            all-time high, breaking the prolonged stagnation in the cryptocurrency market.

                            A few months later, the financial watchdog approved ether spot ETFs, which many analysts
                            predict could attract even greater interest from investors. This optimism stems from the
                            ethereum blockchain’s widespread applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi)
                            and decentralized applications (dApps).

                            Now, the conversation among investors has shifted to what’s next. Will the SEC continue to
                            expand the range of crypto ETFs? Two promising candidates for future ETFs are Solana and
                            XRP. Below, we’ll explore what these potential offerings could mean for the market.

                            Solana and Solana ETFs: What are they?

                            Founded in 2017, Solana is a high-performance blockchain network designed to support dApps.
                            Known for its speed, Solana can process transactions at a significantly faster rate than
                            other blockchains such as ethereum. While ethereum handles around 12-15 transactions per
                            second, Solana claims to support up to 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the
                            fastest blockchain networks in the space. Additionally, Solana offers lower transaction
                            fees, which enhances its appeal to developers and users.

                            Thanks to its speed and cost-efficiency, Solana has gained a reputation as a formidable
                            competitor to ethereum — Solana has often been dubbed the “ethereum killer.” Its native
                            token, Solana, or SOL, plays a crucial role in securing the network and providing rewards to
                            participants. As of early October, it is trading at $137, nearly 500% higher than last year,
                            when it was $23.

                            Solana ETF, if approved, would be an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of SOL,
                            offering investors a way to gain exposure to Solana’s ecosystem without needing to directly
                            purchase and hold SOL tokens. This would allow traditional investors to benefit from
                            Solana’s growth potential through a more familiar investment vehicle.

                            XRP and XRP ETFs: What are they?

                            XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. It is used by the
                            Ripple payment network to facilitate cross-border transactions and is designed to act as a
                            bridge currency. It’s important to note that Ripple, the company, operates the network but
                            does not own XRP. Unlike bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins, XRP has a
                            total supply of 100 billion tokens. It is currently trading at $0.52, down 3% from the
                            previous year.

                            If the XRP ETF receives approval from the SEC, it will track the price of XRP, providing
                            investors with a means to gain exposure to the XRP ecosystem without having to directly
                            purchase and hold XRP tokens.

                            Will Solana and XRP spot ETF get approval?

                            The SEC has historically taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrency ETFs, prioritizing
                            investor protection and regulatory compliance. However, the recent approval of bitcoin spot
                            ETFs has opened the door for other cryptocurrencies such as Solana and XRP to follow suit.

                            Earlier this week, cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise filed for the first spot XRP ETF.
                            Similarly, investment manager VanEck submitted an application to list the first Solana spot
                            ETF in the U.S. earlier this year. Moreover, asset manager 21Shares also filed for a spot
                            Solana exchange, marking the second major application of its kind in 2024.

                            Currently, several investment products linked to Solana are available, including Grayscale’s
                            Solana Trust (GSOL) and VanEck’s Solana ETP (VSOL), which can be accessed in select regions.

                            There is growing optimism in the market that new crypto ETFs may receive the green light
                            within this year or next. This shift could enhance investment opportunities in the
                            cryptocurrency space and attract a broader range of institutional and retail investors.

                            As the landscape evolves, the SEC’s decisions will be closely watched for indications of how
                            it plans to regulate this emerging asset class.

                            In a move that startled market analysts, an Ethereum whale recently took out an astonishing
                            amount of $3.2 million worth of ETH from cold storage. This move denotes a new beginning in
                            her strategy. It is the most active participants in the market who monitor the buying
                            activity of the whale, and this time, the whale decided to change her tactics by swapping
                            her ETH for XRP, SOL, and RXS, which is a booming cryptocurrency currently selling for
                            $0.05. The latter comes at a time when the market is highly volatile and the likes of
                            Ethereum are facing stiff competition from new projects and investors are looking for new
                            avenues to generate high returns.

                            A new road ahead: ETH replacing Ripple, Solana, and Rexas Finance

                            A cold wallet is usually not touched in trading for a long time, so the withdrawal of such a
                            substantial sum of Ethereum (ETH) from cold storage signals a shift in the whale’s
                            investment principles. Usually, holdings in cold storage imply commitment for a long time,
                            but in this situation, sitting liquid with ETH reveals expectations of better alternative
                            instruments than Ethereum within the near future. The Whale also picked Ripple (XRP) and
                            Solana (SOL); these were picked among praying cryptos with talented aces and marketing
                            strength. But the most intriguing development is the addition of Rexas Finance (RXS), a
                            nascent cryptocurrency that deals in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which signifies
                            the whales bet on a nascent and growing area of the blockchain industry.

                            Ripple (XRP): Activity of Whales is a major event

                            In recent months, Ripple’s XRP, a currency with fast, low-cost transfers adapted for
                            cross-industry uses, found itself on a bumpy road due to many factors. It traded in a range
                            for a while, yet XRP is still attractive to large investors as it has practical applications
                            in making cross-border transactions and in the decentralized XRP ledger. Most recently, only
                            in the week alone, traders classified as whales, based on transaction amounts, withdrew more
                            than 252 million XRP from the exchanges, which is a sign of lower selling pressure and
                            positive expectations regarding the future price increase. These whale movements respect the
                            view that XRP is currently in a growth phase as more financial institutions begin to use its
                            technology to ease cross-border payments. The analysts noted the movement of the XRP
                            rotation and forecast that this coin could pull up in a couple of weeks and enhance the
                            value of the whale’s recent purchase.

                            Solana (SOL): Scalability and increasing demand from investors

                            Solana has very quickly secured its place in the ranking of the most discussed blockchain
                            platforms in the cryptocurrency market. With fast transaction speeds and the ability to
                            optimize for scalability, Solana actively competes with other layered blockchain networks
                            such as Ethereum and Cardano. The inbuilt framework that doesn’t incorporate
                            sharding/second-layer solutions makes the platform attractive to developers and investors in
                            equal measure. Recently, the price of Solana has been recuperating greatly and surging above
                            some key technical levels, such as the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. With more and more adoption
                            of Solana and new projects joining its ecosystem, the sitting jackpots enhance the view
                            regarding its future price increase. Some of them expect that Solana’s price will exceed
                            $200 come October, which would be a godsend for the ETH whale who traded his coins for SOL.

                            Rexas Finance (RXS): The next generation in securitization of real-world assets

                            The most remarkable event that occurred in the whale portfolio regarding novelties made is
                            the acquisition of Rexas Finance (RXS), which is a new cryptocurrency on presale. Priced at
                            $0.05 at the moment, RXS signifies a new horizon in the crypto industry, especially in terms
                            of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWA). It is a transformative solution for property and
                            other valuable assets, which allows individuals to subdivide and trade the asset without the
                            restrictions typical in conventional asset trading. Users and businesses can tokenize assets
                            easily on Rexas Finance’s platform. There are no complications involved, as is typical with
                            such processes. As RXS continues with its presale phases, it has received a lot of early
                            investors, and analysts are forecasting a return of 45x by the year 2025. The whale has,
                            however, decided to invest in Rexas Finance at this stage because he has faith in the
                            potential growth of this project over time. The current Rexas Finance presale is also
                            bearing fruit, as nearly 76.74% of the funding target has been met with $1.99 million raised
                            and over 49 million RXS tokens sold. The next presale stage will make it compulsory to sell
                            the tokens at $0.06; early investors such as the Ethereum whale are positioned for
                            considerable gains as soon as the platform develops as it promises.

                            A new investment opportunity

                            Turning to Ripple, Solana, and Rexas Finance shows the Ethereum whale’s desire to explore a
                            new strategy. Investors are likely to notice more demand for visionary alternative cryptos.
                            ETH may still be the king of all cryptocurrencies; however, these other assets have
                            potential, be it Ripple’s ability to transform the remittances business, Solana’s new way of
                            dealing with scalability, or Rexas Finance in the field of real-world asset tokenization.
                            Moving on to the next segment, one cannot predict whether this will be a threat to the
                            market or help it grow. The latter may be true looking at the bold strategy of the whale as
                            something that would eventually happen, opening the way for new emerging cryptos like Rexas
                            Finance to go up against the strong existing ones and make better ways of bringing in
                            profits.

                    WazirX, Government Officials Meet Amid Probe Into Rs 2,000 Crore Crypto Hack
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, which suffered a massive Rs 2,000 crore (about $234 million)
                            cyber theft in July as millions of users still wait for their money in digital assets to be
                            refunded, is now facing scrutiny from top government agencies in the country.

                            According to reports, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Indian Computer Emergency
                            Response Team (CERT-In) officials have met the top leadership of WazirX, asking them about
                            the hacking of crypto tokens, as the government is concerned about the impacts on WazirX
                            investors.

                            The crypto exchange has provided information as sought and probe agencies are scanning
                            through the details, as per sources.

                            Legal experts in the country had earlier asked for a thorough investigation by state
                            authorities, considering the magnitude of the WazirX cyber-crime.

                            WazirX has already admitted that nearly 43 per cent of its users are likely to lose their
                            money stolen in digital assets, affecting users from India the most.

                            In the meantime, hackers behind the WazirX theft have started withdrawing stolen digital
                            assets via the Tornado Cash platform, which is an open-source, fully decentralised
                            cryptocurrency mixer platform that runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible networks.

                            New reports surfaced last week, saying WazirX removed the video of a live town hall session
                            on YouTube, where the management claimed to share "100 per cent profits from any crypto
                            price appreciation in future with users".

                            In the town hall session, WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty and George Gwee, director of
                            Kroll legal firm handling WazirX restructuring post the hack, answered queries from affected
                            users.

                            As per The Crypto Times, Gwee said in the video that any profits made from crypto price
                            appreciation during the restructuring process would be shared 100 per cent with users.
                            Later, the live video was made 'private' by the WazirX management.

                            Shetty claimed in the Townhall session that 87 per cent of the total 4.4 million users of
                            the exchange hold only 8 per cent of funds in the exchange.

                    Cash out Tether USDT to Euro in Riga - The Baltic Times
                </h3>

                            As technology developed, it was only natural that a fundamentally new cryptocurrency system
                            would emerge. Since the foundation of this system, the number of coins available for use has
                            increased significantly. Today, several thousand options exist, including top currencies
                            such as Tether USDT stablecoin in TRC-20 network. Popularity directly depends on the
                            underlying blockchain system, capitalization, and functionality.

                            Regardless of what exactly cryptocurrencies are planned to be used for - as a means of
                            payment or a working financial asset, it is necessary to clearly understand the algorithm of
                            actions. The easiest way to convert, if necessary, is through services such as
                            cryptocurrency exchangers. You can choose the best one in several ways.

                            How to choose the best cryptocurrency exchanger?

                            To cash out Tether USDT to Euro in Riga was always profitable, the easiest way is to choose
                            an exchanger through a special monitoring service. The benefit in this case is obvious:

                            - saving personal time;

                            - receiving truthful and reliable information;

                            - updating information if it is necessary to confirm the expected forecasts of growth or
                            fall in the price of the cryptocurrency assets used.

                            If you choose a cryptocurrency exchanger to cash out Tether for Euro cash in Riga, you need
                            to perform the following checks step by step:

                            - legal rights of the company to operate as a financial intermediary, that is, you need to
                            find information on registration and license in publicly available registries;

                            - clarification of cash flows, company capital, cash reserves in different accounts in
                            reserves, and. This information should not be fake but reliable;

                            - checking the number of available services — this applies to both the number of currency
                            pairs, including crypto, fiat, electronic money, and the possibility of exchange (online,
                            for cash in euro or another currency);

                            - registration conditions and limits — are important for those who do not want to fall under
                            the close attention of the financial supervisory authorities of the centralized government
                            for their cash turnover.

                            Thus, the aggregator of reliable exchange services with crypto exchange rates, such as
                            www.bestchange.com, is a truly rational solution. It should be used by experienced traders,
                            investors, and beginners in cryptocurrencies.

                            Why is it profitable to use crypto exchangers?

                            The option of converting some types of cryptocurrencies is available in all crypto wallets.
                            However, the choice of available coins is usually very limited. Using a cryptocurrency
                            exchanger from Bestchange allows you to:

                            - instantly convert any type of money in absolutely any direction;

                            - seamlessly receive or give fiat cash if such a need arises in the process of working with
                            cryptocurrencies;

                            - in a convenient format, conduct any transaction with the fastest possible registration on
                            the platform.

                            In order for each transaction to be safe, it is necessary to choose the right platform in
                            Latvia for conducting transactions with crypto, taking into account the basic principles of
                            the irrevocable nature of all payments with digital coins. For this, you need to use the
                            services of a monitoring site, through which it is easy to determine the best service for
                            individual criteria.

                            The crypto market was largely in the red on Monday, October 7, with most cryptocurrencies
                            facing losses. Bitcoin saw minor declines of less than 1% on both international and domestic
                            exchanges. As per CoinMarketCap data, BTC was trading at $63,625 (roughly Rs. 53.4 lakh) on
                            global platforms. On Indian exchanges like CoinSwitch and CoinDCX, however, it was priced
                            higher at around $65,430 (roughly Rs. 54.9 lakh).



                            “Bitcoin's upward trend coincides with increasing institutional interest and the expectation
                            of the next US presidential election, which could greatly impact market sentiment. With a
                            year-to-date increase of 49.2 percent, Bitcoin continues to assert itself as the
                            top-performing asset of 2024,” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin told Gadgets360. “Q4 is
                            usually bullish for Bitcoin because of favorable regulatory developments and higher spot ETF
                            demand. As trading volumes increase and investor enthusiasm builds, the outlook for Bitcoin
                            and the broader crypto market remains bright.”



                            Ether reflected a price dip of around 0.30 percent on Monday. The value of ETH stands at
                            $2,487 (roughly Rs. 2.08 lakh) on international exchanges, whereas on national exchanges ETH
                            is trading at $2,086 (roughly Rs. 1.75 lakh), showed the crypto price tracker.IMF Asks El

                            Ether, Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Ripple, and Dogecoin saw losses next to BTC and ETH
                            on the price chart.



                            Tron, Cardano, Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Near Protocol, Leo, and Stellar also saw losses on
                            Monday.



                            Despite the losses seen by most crypto assets on Monday, the overall valuation of the crypto
                            market rose by two percent in the last 24 hours. With this, the sector's capitalisation has
                            reached $2.21 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,85,57,038 crore), as per CoinMarketCap.Indonesia’s

                            Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, Litecoin, and Cronos saw gains alongside Cosmos, Polygon,
                            Bitcoin SV, Elrond, Zcash, and Dash.



                            “Overall, the crypto market is showing signs of recovery after recent dips, supported by
                            increasing confidence in the sector and improving investor sentiment. Meanwhile, altcoins
                            like Avalanche (up 5.15 percent) and Shiba Inu (up 4.83 percent) are among the top gainers,
                            benefiting from the market's momentum,” Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder and CEO, Pi42 told
                            Gadgets360.



                            As per crypto analysts, the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have caused BTC
                            to drop in the shorter term. The market experts have also noted that as Gold continues to
                            rise, BTC might soon follow the upward trajectory as well.

                            As the crypto space advances, numerous investors are scouting for the most effective means
                            to invest to reap the highest returns in the fourth quarter of the year 2024. Even though
                            Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have remained effective challengers in the altcoin midfield,
                            one more contender is all the more heading over a sudden emergence: Rexas Finance (RXS).
                            With groundbreaking plans of asset tokenization, having a successful presale, and a
                            promotional event taking place, Rexas Finance is making a strong case for the most promising
                            altcoin to invest in come October 2024. In this post, we will look at three coins, namely
                            Ethereum, Solana, and Rexas Finance, with a focus on why Rexas Finance is the coin to watch
                            for savvy investors.

                            Ethereum (ETH): King of the smart contract realm

                            Ethereum ranks second in cryptocurrency only after Bitcoin and continues to be the favourite
                            of those looking to invest in smart contracts and dApps. Its progressive development
                            structure has opened many possibilities to the Defi and the NFT sectors.

                            Strengths of Ethereum:

                            Ethereum has sustained tier one in the crypto development end guiding the creation of
                            several thousands of dApps and tokens on the network.

                            Ethereum is not standing still with the previous problems of gas fees and a long wait period
                            for transaction confirmation as the enhancements of Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions such
                            as Optimism and Arbitrum are tackling these concerns. Because Ethereum is the most
                            recommended blockchain platform for deploying any form of decentralized applications, its
                            security and the extent of its marketplace are critical and unrivalled.

                            However, the achievements of Ethereum also have their negative sides:

                            High Fees: Even with Layer 2 solutions in place, the gas fees which have been termed as the
                            catchphrase among Ethereum users, predominantly in the crypto market remain to be the
                            potential buyers’ weakest point.

                            Congestion: There is still room for improvement, despite the advancement in Ethereum’s
                            recent technologies the project still suffers from congestion issues, which limits its
                            scalability benefits compared with other recent blockchains.

                            Even though Ethereum continues to be a powerful weapon, spawned more recently projects such
                            as Rexas Finance involve more focused advancements but then at lower costs, they would be
                            more operable in extremely fast growth.

                            Solana (SOL): Swifter and Efficient, but with peaks to overcome

                            Blockchain as a term is no longer a hype but a treacherous broader of ninety-five fractions
                            out of a hundred in popularity. This is because Solana facilitates its users on an advanced
                            level with a smart cost-effective blockchain network alongside a faster speed. This one has
                            been called an ‘Ethereum killer’, perhaps a bit too early, due to its TPS or transactions
                            per second speed being in thousands. The beauty of this is however that it is able to do
                            this at a very minimal cost.

                            Strengths of Solana:

                            Speed: However, the fact remains that they are currently not limited to only that, Solana
                            has exceptionally unique capabilities when it comes to Processing transactions with the use
                            of its blockchain and is peripheral processing about 65,000 TPS around the clock.

                            Low Fees: Also, the cost of the transaction fees on Solana is less compared to that of
                            Ethereum, which makes it more pragmatic for dApp developers to make use of the Solana
                            platform.

                            Growing Ecosystem: This is despite the pitfalls that the Solana ecosystem has faced of late
                            but the ecosystem development has been swift, particularly in DeFi, NFTs, and Gaming.

                            Still, the fact remains that Solana had to grapple with huge technical challenges including
                            network failure and downtimes that are a source of worry for its continuity. The instability
                            of the blockchain also led to disgruntlement from users and developers alike and hence the
                            potential for its growth would be lower compared to stronger projects like Rexas Finance.

                            Rexas Finance (RXS): Blockchain of the new era for tokenization of any real-world assets

                            On the one hand, there seems to be a new player in the arena which is Rexas Finance (RXS)
                            which has set its sights on the tokenization of real-world assets. The growth and
                            development of such a sector are said to change the dynamics of industries with the
                            tokenization and the exchange of properties like real estate, gold, and goods among other
                            physical properties through the blockchain. Based on these unique selling propositions,
                            Rexas Finance is the best altcoin to buy now in October 2024.

                            benefits for those coming in early since a large listing price of about $0.20 could be
                            listed, translating to a gain of almost 500x

                    SiBAN refutes expulsion claims, reaffirms commitment to blockchain regulation
                </h3>

                            The Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria has reaffirmed the
                            stability of their leadership while underscoring their commitment to strengthening
                            regulatory oversight within the blockchain ecosystem.

                            This was stated in a press release issued by SiBAN on Sunday.

                            SiBAN also denied reports claiming that its President, Obinna Iwuno, had been expelled,
                            describing the allegations as baseless and misleading.

                            The clarification was issued in response to accusations made by the Blockchain Industry
                            Coordinating Committee of Nigeria, which alleged that Iwuno had been suspended from his
                            position as SiBAN President.

                            BICCoN accused Iwuno and his associates of unethical behaviour, including the unauthorised
                            incorporation of “The Registered Trustees of SiBAN”, an entity BICCoN described as an
                            impostor organisation of SiBAN.

                            BICCoN is composed of three major blockchain bodies in Nigeria—Blockchain Nigeria User
                            Group, Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria, and SiBAN. The committee was formed
                            on 13 January 2021 during a stakeholder engagement aimed at addressing the growing problem
                            of crypto scams in Nigeria.

                            BICCoN, which considers SiBAN a key member of its organisation, stated: “We stand in strong
                            opposition to the recent unethical actions attributed to Mr Obinna Iwuno and his
                            accomplices.”

                            In its rebuttal, SiBAN denied these allegations, asserting that no suspension had taken
                            place.

                            The association described the claims as the work of a “faceless group” attempting to disrupt
                            the organisation’s efforts to regulate and promote transparency within the blockchain
                            industry.

                            “There is no crisis within SiBAN. Our President, the Executive Council, and the Board of
                            Trustees continue to manage the association smoothly while engaging with key stakeholders in
                            the digital currency ecosystem,” part of the statement read.

                            SiBAN further accused the group behind the expulsion claims of trying to establish an
                            illegitimate administration that could enable fraudulent activities within the industry.

                            The association underscored its commitment to addressing widespread scams, unlicensed
                            operations, and other issues that have negatively affected Nigeria’s blockchain space.

                            “These actions are not only a distraction but also an attempt to resist the reforms we are
                            undertaking to dismantle fraudulent practices, such as the creation of unregulated crypto
                            hedge funds and meme coins, which have cost Nigerians millions,” SiBAN noted.

                            The association vowed to continue working on initiatives that promote transparency,
                            regulatory compliance, and the development of a secure blockchain environment for businesses
                            and investors.

                            SiBAN also urged the public to be cautious when engaging with the group spreading these
                            false claims, warning that interacting with them could pose significant risks.

                            It called on those with legitimate concerns to seek redress through the proper legal
                            channels.

                    Trump Memecoins Pump After Elon Musk's Pennsylvania Speech – Did Tech Mogul Promote $DMAGA?

                            Political memecoins based on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pumped Sunday
                            after tech billionaire Elon Musk took the stage beside the GOP frontrunner in a 5-minute
                            speech that started with "Dark MAGA."Musk joined Trump in his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally
                            Saturday, in the same site where the former president survived an assassination attempt back
                            in July. The tech mogul wore a "Make America Great Again" cap as he urged Americans to
                            deliver the November victory for Trump.Pennsylvania is a key battleground state in this
                            year's elections. Political experts have said that among other swing states, the Keystone
                            State can make or break the upcoming election.Did Musk Just Promote $DMAGA?"As you can see I
                            am not just MAGA – I am Dark MAGA," the SpaceX founder said at the beginning of his speech.
                            It is unclear if he was referring specifically to the Dark MAGA (DMAGA) memecoin, which has
                            seen an over 32% decrease in the last 24 hours but has been rallying by more than 200% in
                            the last seven days.In a statement following Musk's speech, the team behind the Dark MAGA
                            coin said they communicated "directly with Elon a second time" before the tech titan
                            attended Saturday's rally."He agreed that supporting the Dark MAGA movement to re-elect
                            Trump was important to show people how serious this election is. Elon chose to collaborate
                            with us again, wore the Dark MAGA hat, and gave us a shout-out in full support," the team
                            wrote.Notably, Musk said in July that he will not promote cryptocurrencies, "at most in a
                            joking way." It's unclear whether his stances have changed since then, considering how many
                            in the crypto space have aired support for Trump in recent months.Key Takeaways from Musk
                            SpeechThe Tesla CEO's speech was welcomed by a Trump crowd, who cheered as the former
                            president called in "one of the people who's going to help us build this incredible future."
                            An Extraordinary Election – The tech visionary noted that this year's election "is no
                            ordinary election." Indeed, the lead-up to the Nov. 5 election has been extraordinary,
                            especially for crypto users, whose voices – seemingly for the first time since Bitcoin first
                            entered the economy – are now being heard by many politicians.
                            Free Speech and Democracy – Musk reiterated that "free speech is the bedrock of democracy."
                            He said people need to know what's going on, and they need to know the truth so they can
                            make "an informed vote." He said Trump should win the presidency so democracy in the U.S.
                            can be preserved. "This is a must-win situation," he said with urgency.
                            The Last Election – The X owner said that if Americans fail to vote this year, "this will be
                            the last election." He followed up his warning with a call to the crowd to remember that
                            every vote counts.
                            Trump-Themed PolitiFi Tokens SoarThe Butler rally's electric atmosphere appears to have
                            affected many Trump-based PolitiFi (political finance) memecoins, including MAGA (TRUMP),
                            the world's second-largest political token by market value, which increased by over 19% in
                            the last 24 hours, as per CoinGecko data.MAGA Hat (MAGA) climbed by more than 32% overnight
                            since the rally, and Doland Tremp (TREMP) pumped by 37.3%. MAGA Again (MAGAA) rallied by
                            15.2% in the past day, Fight to MAGA (FIGHT) was up by nearly 11%, and even Vice President
                            Kamala Harris-based Kamala Horris (KAMA) soared by over 35%.Many other Trump-themed
                            political coins were in the green from Saturday through Sunday night, but Pepe Trump
                            (PTRUMP) was the largest gainer, adding nearly 53% in the last 24 hours.Musk has since
                            changed his profile picture on X with a photo of him wearing the "Make America Great Again"
                            cap at the Butler rally.

                    AI tokens push crypto markets higher as U.S. economy shows resilience
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Cryptocurrency markets are seeing a revival, largely led by AI-focused tokens, thanks to
                            optimistic economic data from the U.S. and signals of recovery in the broader crypto space.
                            A stronger-than-expected jobs report has bolstered confidence, showing the U.S. added
                            251,000 jobs in September, calming concerns about a potential recession. This labor market
                            strength has positively impacted market sentiment, as a robust economy hints at the
                            possibility of future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which could create a more
                            favorable environment for digital assets.

                            AI-driven cryptocurrencies have been at the forefront of this upswing. With AI technologies
                            becoming more embedded in everyday applications and industries, investors have placed
                            renewed faith in tokens linked to AI projects, including SingularityNET and Fetch.ai, both
                            of which have recorded impressive gains. These AI tokens are now perceived as holding
                            substantial future value due to their connection to artificial intelligence, a field
                            projected to drive technological growth across sectors.

                            The broader cryptocurrency market has also shown signs of stabilization after what has been
                            a volatile year. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the market, appeared to bottom out at around
                            $60,000, recovering after a sell-off in early October. Analysts believe that the worst of
                            the downturn may be over, with several forecasting a period of gradual price recovery,
                            driven by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic performance and the potential easing
                            of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies.

                            Experts point out that Bitcoin’s recovery and the rally in AI tokens can be tied directly to
                            these macroeconomic forces. AI tokens, in particular, have benefited from the tech sector’s
                            rising influence, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, often viewed as inflation
                            hedges, thrive on speculation that the Federal Reserve might lower rates. Such moves could
                            shift investor appetite toward riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

                    The Role of User Feedback in Game Development for Bitcoin Casinos
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            As Bitcoin casinos continue to gain popularity in the online gambling landscape, developers
                            are constantly seeking ways to enhance user experience, increase security, and stay ahead of
                            the competition.

                            One of the most effective strategies to achieve these goals is through user feedback.

                            The feedback provided by players is an invaluable resource for Bitcoin casino developers, as
                            it helps them understand user preferences, address potential issues, and create a more
                            engaging and secure environment.

                            In this article, we’ll explore the significant role of user feedback in game development for
                            Bitcoin casinos, with a special focus on the review of anonymous casino sites.

                            Understanding User Needs Through Feedback

                            One of the primary roles of user feedback in game development is to offer insights into the
                            needs and preferences of players.

                            By paying close attention to reviews and comments, especially on anonymous casino sites,
                            developers can identify patterns that highlight the most sought-after features and pain
                            points experienced by users.

                            Since anonymous casino sites prioritize user privacy and security, feedback from players
                            using these platforms can be particularly insightful when improving features related to
                            anonymity and decentralized payment options like Bitcoin.

                            For instance, players often provide reviews on aspects such as the ease of Bitcoin
                            transactions, the level of privacy protection, and the overall security of the platform.

                            Developers can then use this data to refine their systems, ensuring that they meet the
                            expectations of players who value discretion and anonymity.

                            Improving Game Features Based on Feedback

                            User feedback isn’t just helpful in understanding player preferences—it is also a critical
                            component in game feature development.

                            Players on Bitcoin casinos are typically early adopters of technology, and their feedback on
                            game mechanics, user interfaces, and overall gameplay experience can guide developers in
                            creating more engaging and innovative features.

                            When players on anonymous casino sites leave reviews, they often mention the specific games
                            they enjoy, the type of bonuses they appreciate, and their satisfaction with the platform’s
                            usability.

                            For example, if several reviews point out that a particular game lacks excitement or
                            fairness, developers can investigate the game’s mechanics to make adjustments.

                            They can also prioritize creating games that are fast, fair, and highly enjoyable to meet
                            the expectations of the crypto-savvy community.

                            Encouraging User-Driven Innovation

                            Incorporating user feedback in game development also fosters a culture of user-driven
                            innovation.

                            Many of the most successful features in Bitcoin casinos have come directly from player
                            suggestions. By continually engaging with the community and encouraging feedback, developers
                            open the door to creative ideas that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.

                            For example, a review of anonymous casino sites may suggest introducing more customizable
                            gameplay options or unique bonus structures tailored for crypto users. Developers who listen
                            to these suggestions can turn them into unique selling points that differentiate their
                            platform from competitors.

                            Enhancing Security and Privacy

                            A key reason why players gravitate toward Bitcoin casinos is the promise of enhanced
                            security and privacy. The feedback loop from users of anonymous casino sites often
                            highlights concerns about personal data security, fairness in games, and the protection of
                            digital assets.

                            Reviews of these platforms provide vital information for developers to stay up-to-date on
                            potential vulnerabilities or areas where security could be improved.

                            For example, reviews may point out issues with withdrawal times, doubts about the randomness
                            of the games, or perceived risks associated with Bitcoin transactions.

                            These reviews serve as a valuable resource for developers to implement stronger encryption
                            methods, improve payout systems, or integrate more transparent verification processes.

                            This constant adjustment helps foster trust and solidify the platform’s reputation for being
                            a secure place to gamble anonymously.

                            Adapting to Market Trends

                            The Bitcoin casino market is rapidly evolving, and keeping up with these changes is
                            essential for staying competitive.

                            User feedback from various anonymous casino sites provides developers with real-time data on
                            emerging trends, including preferences for particular cryptocurrencies, new game formats, or
                            shifts in how players approach online gambling.

                            For example, many Bitcoin casino reviews may highlight a growing interest in live dealer
                            games or decentralized finance (DeFi) options within the platform.

                            Developers can then adapt their offerings to meet these demands, integrating cutting-edge
                            technology to improve user satisfaction.

                            This adaptive approach also helps casinos maintain their relevance in an industry known for
                            its fast-paced changes.

                            Building Trust Through Transparency

                            Reviews of anonymous casino sites play a crucial role in building trust with the user base.
                            Transparency is especially important in the Bitcoin gambling space, as users rely on the
                            security and fairness of the platform without revealing personal information.

                            By encouraging users to leave honest feedback and addressing any concerns or suggestions
                            raised, developers can build a reputation for being transparent and responsive.

                            For instance, responding to player reviews by publicly addressing issues like withdrawal
                            times or game fairness demonstrates a commitment to maintaining high standards.
                            Additionally, casinos that actively engage with their community through feedback often see
                            an increase in player loyalty, as users appreciate being heard and valued.

                            User feedback is an essential component of game development for Bitcoin casinos,
                            particularly when considering the insights gained from reviews of anonymous casino sites.

                            Developers who actively seek and act on this feedback can create better user experiences,
                            enhance security, and stay ahead of the curve in a competitive market.

                            As the landscape of online gambling continues to evolve, the role of user feedback will
                            remain pivotal in shaping the future of Bitcoin casinos, ensuring that these platforms
                            continue to meet the expectations of a tech-savvy and privacy-conscious audience.

                            As the crypto industry continues to evolve, both businesses and individual users seek tools
                            that simplify transactions, promote interoperability, and speed up processes. Bitget is
                            stepping up with a $20 million fund aimed at growing the TON ecosystem, while the SUI Bridge
                            is facilitating smoother cross-chain asset transfers between Sui and Ethereum.

                            Meanwhile, Plus Wallet has emerged as a standout tool for managing crypto, offering
                            exclusive features like streamlined invoicing and fast token listings. This makes it an
                            attractive alternative to MetaMask for both businesses and individual users adopting
                            cryptocurrency.

                            Bitget Invests $20M in Expanding the TON Ecosystem

                            Bitget recently announced a $20 million fund dedicated to the development of the TON (The
                            Open Network) ecosystem. This initiative is aimed at enhancing the utility of the TON
                            blockchain, particularly in the areas of decentralized applications (dApps), smart
                            contracts, and blockchain solutions integrated with Telegram’s large user base.

                            This fund has the potential to drive innovation across the TON ecosystem. Its success,
                            however, will depend on strategic project selection and the ability to navigate the complex
                            regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).

                            SUI Bridge Launches for Cross-Chain Asset Transfers

                            The SUI Bridge has officially gone live on the Mainnet, enabling secure transfers between
                            the Sui and Ethereum blockchains. Users can now move ETH and WETH effortlessly between the
                            two ecosystems, providing a trust-minimized, cross-chain solution.

                            This tool is poised to enhance Web3 interoperability, making it easier for users to engage
                            with decentralized applications and DeFi projects. Currently supporting ETH and WETH, future
                            updates are anticipated to expand the range of assets that can be transferred, broadening
                            SUI’s network integration capabilities.

                            Plus Wallet’s Streamlined Invoicing & Fast Token Listings

                            As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, businesses are increasingly adopting digital
                            assets to streamline operations. Plus Wallet addresses this demand by offering a simple yet
                            powerful solution for handling cryptocurrency transactions.

                            One of the standout features of Plus Wallet is its invoicing system, which allows businesses
                            to generate, send, and track invoices efficiently. Whether billing in traditional currencies
                            or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Plus Wallet ensures that payments are fast
                            and secure.

                            The wallet consolidates multiple functions into one platform, making it ideal for companies
                            with international clients or diverse crypto portfolios. Supporting multiple currencies,
                            Plus Wallet’s versatility sets it apart.

                            In addition to invoicing, Plus Wallet also excels in token listings. While other platforms
                            may take days to approve and list new tokens, Plus Wallet enables quick listings within 15
                            minutes. This feature is especially useful for projects seeking a rapid and efficient
                            launch, eliminating delays and ensuring a seamless rollout.

                            By combining a user-friendly invoicing system with swift token listings, Plus Wallet is
                            quickly becoming a go-to solution for businesses and individual users alike.

                            The Final Thought

                            Bitget’s $20 million fund is set to boost the TON ecosystem by fostering the growth of
                            decentralized projects. The SUI Bridge is enhancing cross-chain transfers between Sui and
                            Ethereum, improving asset mobility across networks.

                            However, when it comes to efficiently managing digital assets, Plus Wallet truly stands out.
                            With its advanced invoicing features and fast token listings, Plus Wallet offers a
                            streamlined approach to handling crypto transactions. As a robust MetaMask alternative, it

                    UAE Exempts Crypto Transfers from Value-Added Tax
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The United Arab Emirates has introduced a significant tax reform, exempting value-added tax
                            (VAT) on the transfer and conversion of cryptocurrencies. This decision, effective from
                            January 1, 2018, aims to bolster the growth of the crypto market in the UAE, aligning the
                            country with global trends favoring digital asset investments. Alongside these exemptions,
                            the new regulations extend to additional services related to managing investment funds and
                            virtual assets.

                            This reform marks a pivotal shift in the UAE’s approach to digital currencies, reflecting an
                            effort to enhance the nation’s position as a hub for financial innovation and technology. As
                            the global crypto landscape evolves, the UAE aims to attract businesses and investors by
                            minimizing tax burdens, which could potentially stimulate economic activity within the
                            sector.

                            The announcement includes provisions that exempt investment fund management services from
                            VAT, addressing a significant gap in the taxation framework that previously imposed VAT on
                            these services. Fund managers will now have a clearer regulatory environment as they
                            operate, and this change could lead to a surge in the establishment of crypto-related
                            investment funds in the region .

                            Experts predict that the VAT exemption will encourage more companies to engage with
                            cryptocurrencies, enhancing liquidity in the market and fostering innovation. Firms
                            previously deterred by tax implications may find the UAE a more attractive jurisdiction for
                            crypto trading and investment. However, businesses involved in these transactions are
                            advised to review their VAT accounting practices retrospectively to ensure compliance since
                            the original implementation date.

                            The retroactive application of the exemption emphasizes the UAE’s commitment to not only
                            facilitating current operations but also correcting any previous tax burdens faced by
                            businesses in the cryptocurrency sector. Stakeholders will need to reassess their tax
                            strategies, especially regarding the potential recovery of input VAT on expenses incurred
                            from January 2018 onwards.

                    LEGO Shop Gets Briefly Hijacked by Crypto Scam
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might’ve seen a banner featuring a ton of
                            gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by
                            surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website
                            taken over hackers to .

                            According to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4,
                            on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring “Our new LEGO Coin is officially
                            out!” Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens
                            with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began
                            posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the
                            LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven’t been any other attempts to bring back the
                            banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO
                            Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you’re worried about that, Engadget confirmed
                            clicking that banner’s “buy now” link takes you to the collection.

                            How did this happen? LEGO isn’t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating
                            it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been “swiftly resolved.”
                            More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during

                            and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.”

                            Despite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn’t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a
                            regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams
                            have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure
                            you’re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.
