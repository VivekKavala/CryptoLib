                In a move that startled market analysts, an Ethereum whale recently took out an astonishing amount of $3.2 million worth of ETH from cold storage. This move denotes a new beginning in her strategy. It is the most active participants in the market who monitor the buying activity of the whale, and this time, the whale decided to change her tactics by swapping her ETH for XRP, SOL, and RXS, which is a booming cryptocurrency currently selling for $0.05. The latter comes at a time when the market is highly volatile and the likes of Ethereum are facing stiff competition from new projects and investors are looking for new avenues to generate high returns.

A new road ahead: ETH replacing Ripple, Solana, and Rexas Finance

A cold wallet is usually not touched in trading for a long time, so the withdrawal of such a substantial sum of Ethereum (ETH) from cold storage signals a shift in the whale’s investment principles. Usually, holdings in cold storage imply commitment for a long time, but in this situation, sitting liquid with ETH reveals expectations of better alternative instruments than Ethereum within the near future. The Whale also picked Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL); these were picked among praying cryptos with talented aces and marketing strength. But the most intriguing development is the addition of Rexas Finance (RXS), a nascent cryptocurrency that deals in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which signifies the whales bet on a nascent and growing area of the blockchain industry. 

Ripple (XRP): Activity of Whales is a major event

In recent months, Ripple’s XRP, a currency with fast, low-cost transfers adapted for cross-industry uses, found itself on a bumpy road due to many factors. It traded in a range for a while, yet XRP is still attractive to large investors as it has practical applications in making cross-border transactions and in the decentralized XRP ledger. Most recently, only in the week alone, traders classified as whales, based on transaction amounts, withdrew more than 252 million XRP from the exchanges, which is a sign of lower selling pressure and positive expectations regarding the future price increase. These whale movements respect the view that XRP is currently in a growth phase as more financial institutions begin to use its technology to ease cross-border payments. The analysts noted the movement of the XRP rotation and forecast that this coin could pull up in a couple of weeks and enhance the value of the whale’s recent purchase. 

Solana (SOL): Scalability and increasing demand from investors 

Solana has very quickly secured its place in the ranking of the most discussed blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency market. With fast transaction speeds and the ability to optimize for scalability, Solana actively competes with other layered blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Cardano. The inbuilt framework that doesn’t incorporate sharding/second-layer solutions makes the platform attractive to developers and investors in equal measure. Recently, the price of Solana has been recuperating greatly and surging above some key technical levels, such as the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. With more and more adoption of Solana and new projects joining its ecosystem, the sitting jackpots enhance the view regarding its future price increase. Some of them expect that Solana’s price will exceed $200 come October, which would be a godsend for the ETH whale who traded his coins for SOL.

Rexas Finance (RXS): The next generation in securitization of real-world assets

The most remarkable event that occurred in the whale portfolio regarding novelties made is the acquisition of Rexas Finance (RXS), which is a new cryptocurrency on presale. Priced at $0.05 at the moment, RXS signifies a new horizon in the crypto industry, especially in terms of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWA). It is a transformative solution for property and other valuable assets, which allows individuals to subdivide and trade the asset without the restrictions typical in conventional asset trading. Users and businesses can tokenize assets easily on Rexas Finance’s platform. There are no complications involved, as is typical with such processes. As RXS continues with its presale phases, it has received a lot of early investors, and analysts are forecasting a return of 45x by the year 2025. The whale has, however, decided to invest in Rexas Finance at this stage because he has faith in the potential growth of this project over time. The current Rexas Finance presale is also bearing fruit, as nearly 76.74% of the funding target has been met with $1.99 million raised and over 49 million RXS tokens sold. The next presale stage will make it compulsory to sell the tokens at $0.06; early investors such as the Ethereum whale are positioned for considerable gains as soon as the platform develops as it promises.

A new investment opportunity

Turning to Ripple, Solana, and Rexas Finance shows the Ethereum whale’s desire to explore a new strategy. Investors are likely to notice more demand for visionary alternative cryptos. ETH may still be the king of all cryptocurrencies; however, these other assets have potential, be it Ripple’s ability to transform the remittances business, Solana’s new way of dealing with scalability, or Rexas Finance in the field of real-world asset tokenization. Moving on to the next segment, one cannot predict whether this will be a threat to the market or help it grow. The latter may be true looking at the bold strategy of the whale as something that would eventually happen, opening the way for new emerging cryptos like Rexas Finance to go up against the strong existing ones and make better ways of bringing in profits.
