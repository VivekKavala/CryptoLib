                The sudden inflows in the crypto sector, notably in Bitcoin and Ethereum, revived investors’ hopes globally. Many analysts predict a bullish reversal in October, and any potential sentiment changes keep the whales on the edge of their chairs. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) are labelled prime cryptos to moonshot as the month proceeds. 

Similarly, DTX Exchange (DTX) is another emerging crypto standing in line with Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) for a bullish revival, following key developments and surging global interest. In this article, we’ll see how these three cryptos can surge past critical threshold levels and what developments lead to a pump in whale activity.

Midnight Protocol launch sparks demand for Cardano (ADA) 

Cardano (ADA) closed the last month on a bullish note. However, the price has reversed back to the lower support range. Investors took this setback optimistically after Cardano (ADA) announced the testnet launch of Midnight Protocol for developers as a major factor in pumping the price of ADA tokens above $0.4. 

Moreover, the buy-the-dip opportunity and the 18.53M token unlock on October 2 can raise the Cardano (ADA) price once the volatility settles. Experts are positive about Cardano (ADA) in October, predicting that ADA will break the immediate thresholds following surging developmental activities, settling around $0.5 if the bullish pressures persist. 

Litecoin (LTC) poised to hit $100 after MoneyGram collaboration

Litecoin (LTC) is trading in the red after a bearish market pulled the altcoins down to September lows. However, the recent collaboration of Litecoin (LTC) with MoneyGram has multi-folded its scalability and increased its prominence as it allows users in the United States to trade, hold, and sell LTC tokens with a mobile app.

Following a parabolic surge in its active addresses and whale activity, Litecoin (LTC) is set for a bullish 2x rally by mid-October once the market momentum shifts. This bull run can push the ‘Digital Silver’ Litecoin (LTC) to its former glory at $100 and experts are optimistic about this event through technical analysis and market activity. 

DTX Exchange (DTX) presale hits $3.5M: Launch rally on horizon 

DTX Exchange (DTX) is on the road to becoming the biggest and most relevant advanced trading platform for users globally through its 1000x leverage, hybrid model, AI-backed schemas, and the availability of stocks, cryptos, forex, equities, and CFDs on a single platform. This all-in-one platform has raised the bar after grabbing a staggering $3.5M in batch 3 of the public presale. 

This bullish momentum is leading DTX Exchange to near its mainnet launch, which is planned for the end of 2024. Priced at $0.06, DTX tokens exponentially increase their value with each presale stage as predictions suggest that they will break past the $1 level once they start getting listed on major CEX platforms, promising a 5x rally for early investors. 

DTX revolutionary features drive whale activity in presale 

DTX Exchange (DTX) serves as the go-to platform for seasonal and new traders as the end-to-end solution provider from asset management to buying with automation and real-time analytics and from executing transactions over its first-ever hybrid blockchain to earn passive income strategies through liquidity pools and its VIP Rebate Program. 

The DTX platform eliminates gas fees and offers lightning-fast execution alongside governance rights and access to mega airdrops. The KYC-free onboarding and non-custodial wallets are a major addition for data-conscious users. Overall, DTX Exchange (DTX) comes with an all-in-one package and includes the best features of CEX and DEX platforms, being profitable and highly accessible for broader communities of traders. 

Key takeaways

As market volatility lingers amid market downside, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) gear up for 2x rallies. On top of them is DTX Exchange, which has had presale success and bullish gains as it heads toward the mainnet launch in 2024. The combination of technical advancements and growing market interest positions these cryptos as prime candidates for a bullish revival in October’s expected bull run.
