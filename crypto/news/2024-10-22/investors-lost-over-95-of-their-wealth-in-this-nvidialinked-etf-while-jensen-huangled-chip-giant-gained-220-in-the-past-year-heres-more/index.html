Investors in the T-Rex 2X Inverse Nvidia Daily Target ETF (BATS:NVDQ) are grappling with significant losses as shares of Jensen Huang-led Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) experience a remarkable stock surge.

As per Benzinga Pro, the T-Rex ETF has seen a dramatic 96% decline in investor wealth over the past year. This stark contrast comes as Nvidia’s stock has soared by 221.08% during the same timeframe.

Don’t Miss:

This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

However, it is noteworthy that the T-Rex ETF is designed to achieve daily inverse investment results, meaning its long-term performance may not mirror Nvidia’s stock trends. It aims for a daily return of 200% of the inverse of Nvidia’s daily performance, setting it apart from conventional ETFs.

Simply put, this ETF is designed to gain value when Nvidia's stock price decreases and lose value when Nvidia's stock price increases. It achieves this by using derivatives, such as options or futures, to bet against Nvidia’s stock performance.

Meanwhile, Nvidia remains a leader in the chip industry, with its shares closing up 0.8% at $138 on Friday, boosting its market capitalization to over $3 trillion. Experts like Ram Ahluwalia from Lumida Wealth Management are optimistic about Nvidia’s potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation, citing strong demand for GPU chips.

Additionally, Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management forecasts that Nvidia’s revenues and stock could double in the coming years, driven by AI investments. Goldman Sachs and Bofa Securities have also increased their price targets for Nvidia, reflecting confidence in its growth prospects.

Looking For Higher-Yield Opportunities In A Shifting Market?

The changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider. For instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.
