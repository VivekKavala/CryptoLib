                                    Mila Kunis' son knows exactly what he wants to be for Halloween this year.

 The actress, 41, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live and spoke about her son Dimitri's unique Halloween costume. Kunis shares her 7-year-old son and daughter Wyatt, 10, with husband Ashton Kutcher, 46.

 "Okay, honest story. They change costumes monthly," Kunis says when asked if her kids stick with one costume. "So I’m a person that doesn’t procure the costume until much later in the season, you know, I wait. Because the idea of the next costume happens on November 1. They’re like, ‘Ok, next year, I’m going to be…’ and I’m like, ‘Sure, sure, no problem.’"

 "But I do have to tell you my son’s costume, it is actually really funny. So my daughter. Normal Amazon costume," Kunis shares. "She wants to be Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Amazing, right? Like you go, click, buy now, sold. Awesome."

 "My son comes to me and goes, ‘I know what I want to be.’ And I was like, ‘Cool. Like, ninja? Vampire? Where we at?’ He’s like, ‘I want to be the torch holder from the opening of the Paris Olympics Games.’”

 After getting a few "aws" from the audience, Kunis laughs and pushes back, saying that the costume was challenging because it doesn't exist.

 "It’s not a real costume. It’s the guy that like ran around with the torch and did parkour and things. And I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ " Kunis remembers.

 "And so then I Googled it and I was like, maybe Etsy makes it. Nope. Nobody. I have done it. I did it. I went and I bought…I took the photo of the guy in the Olympic Games and I put on my computer and I was like, ‘Okay, I can do this.’ I’m gonna have to get a jacket that has gold buttons in the thing and I started looking it all up and it was exhausting.” 

 In May, Kutcher and Kunis made a rare public appearance with their two kids as they watched Indiana Fever defeat the Los Angeles Sparks during their game in Los Angeles.

 The famous couple were photographed with their daughter and son beaming as they sat courtside to watch the match, as well as post-game when they met Fever rookie Caitlin Clark after her team’s win of 78-73 in L.A.’s Crypto Arena.

 Kutcher could be seen backing Clark at the game as he wore a University of Iowa baseball cap, where both he and the athlete went to college. Dimitri also wore an Iowa Hawkeyes hoodie, representing Clark’s college team.

                                    Mila Kunis' son knows exactly what he wants to be for Halloween this year.

 "Okay, honest story. They change costumes monthly," Kunis says when asked if her kids stick with one costume. "So I’m a person that doesn’t procure the costume until much later in the season, you know, I wait. Because the idea of the next costume happens on November 1.

Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg.

Our breakdown records 76 billionaires supporting Harris and 49 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below).

Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December.

Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris.

A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor.

Forbes will update this list through Election Day.

Big-Time Billionaires Who Haven’t Endorsed A Candidate:

Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.”

Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle.

Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview.

Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added.

Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post last week touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an editorial in the Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a “president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.”

Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate.

Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle.

Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter.

                                    Tesla fans were kept waiting on Thursday for the unveiling of Elon Musk's robotaxi, years after the brash billionaire first promised a car that could drive itself.The company's CEO is a master showman, whose ability to generate hype has helped make Tesla the world's best selling EV and propelled the firm's share price sky high, making him the richest man on the planet in the process.And he's currently employing those talents in the service of Republican Donald Trump, echoing the billionaire presidential candidate's dire warnings about migrants and a crumbling America, including during an exuberant appearance at a weekend Trump rally that was widely mocked.Little is known about what to expect at Thursday's unveiling at an event dubbed "We, Robot" (a play on Isaac Asimov's sci-fi classic 'I, Robot') that will take place at the Warner Brothers studio lot near Los Angeles.But more than 40 minutes after it was supposed to start, tens of thousands of people waiting to see the livestream were left watching the product of a graphics generator.Various crypto scams were stepping into the breach on YouTube, with AI-generated Musks urging viewers to send their Bitcoins for supposed huge profits.Musk told users on X -- the platform formerly known as Twitter -- that event staff were dealing with an emergency."A person in the crowd had a medical emergency. We have taken care of them and will be starting shortly," he wrote.The launch will be closely watched -- both by the boosters who are convinced he is a visionary changing the world, and by the skeptics who increasingly see an emperor with threadbare clothes."We believe wide-scale Tesla robotaxi deployment is unlikely within the coming years," said a note from UBS last month."That is not to say Tesla isn't making technological progress, but Tesla needs to show that the tech is ready and safe, deal with a myriad of local regulations and (potentially) figure out logistics and operations of a transportation network company."On the bullish side, analysts Wedbush predicted Thursday's event will be a "seminal and historical day" for Tesla, ushering in a new chapter of growth for autonomous technology.If Tesla successfully shows off a taxi that can drive itself, it won't be the first.Other companies, such as Google's Waymo and General Motors Cruise, have operated heavily regulated pilot programs for a few years already.But, says Musk, with characteristic bravura, his will be the best.The South African-born entrepreneur pushed back the date of the event, which was originally planned for August, "to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle," he said in July.He shrugged off regulatory questions about a technology venture that has so far only been demonstrated on a limited terrain and remains unseen by most of the general public."Once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human, we find that regulators are supportive of deployment of that capability," he said at the time.Forget that he said in 2016 a fully automated car was two years away, or that a year later he was touting a vehicle by 2019 so clever that customers would be able to sleep while it drove them around.As many car makers have found, self-driving is tricky.While lots of cars nowadays have limited automation, theoretically allowing the driver to cede some of the boring bits of driving to an onboard computer, the person behind the wheel still has to pay attention and jump in if the car does something unpredictable.That's because computers, unlike people, are not very good at reacting to unexpected events or situations they have never seen before, so self-driving vehicles have a history of doing things that a human would never do.The driver is in any case legally liable for what the car does. Tesla is facing a number of lawsuits stemming from deadly crashes in which drivers may have believed they were safe in the hands of the car's computer.It's in this context that some industry watchers are taking Thursday's expected announcements with a pinch of salt."It seems likely that we'll see a cool demo of a stylish-looking prototype, allowing Musk to claim a kind of victory for first impressions, even when the rough outlines of what he promises will barely hold up to scrutiny," wrote Andrew Hawkins of tech outlet The Verge."The exaltations from bullish investors will give him enough cover to continue to make misleading declarations about what is and isn't autonomous. "And the safety experts and competitors who try to warn about the dangers of his approach will likely be drowned out or dismissed by his most ardent fans."

How long do you need to hold Bitcoin to beat the market, regardless of when you bought or sold?

Michael Saylor once claimed that you should never hold Bitcoin for less than four years because you are guaranteed to not lose money. The idea is that if you are holding a highly appreciating asset like Bitcoin, what really matters is the holding period rather than the specifics of when you bought or sold. If the asset appreciates enough, that appreciation will swamp the details of what specific price you bought or sold and, therefore, erase some of the stress from the volatility.

Let's evaluate this claim against Bitcoin price data. First, I'm going to generalize the conjecture to be: “If you hold Bitcoin for time x, you will be guaranteed to earn a return above y.” Saylor took x = four years, and y = zero, but we can actually find what horizon gives the worst return on Bitcoin, and compare that to other investments, like the S&P500.

The Worst Case

I'm going to use a trick from computer science called worst-case analysis. This is a method for evaluating algorithms when you don't necessarily have good information on uncertainty, and instead just want to ask how the algorithm would perform in a worst case. In this case, our “algorithm” is the return to holding Bitcoin, so we want to come up with a measure for the worst return from holding Bitcoin over different horizons. That is the lower bound on your return, since it will represent buying at the highest possible price and selling at the lowest possible price. This is your worst case.

Here's my method. I use daily Bitcoin price data from January 2011 to January 2024. For a fixed holding period, I calculate the return over all possible buys and sells. For example, consider a two year holding period , and compute the 2 year return from buying on 1/1/2011 and selling 2 years later, buying on 1/2/2011 and selling 2 years later, buying on 1/3/2011 and selling 2 years later, etc. That will generate a different return for each possible 2 year holding period. Find the lowest of those returns —- that’s the worst possible 2 year return. (If you’re curious, the worst 2 year return was -46% per year, with a buy on 12/4/2013 and sale at 12/4/2015). Now repeat this calculation for all possible holding periods (2 years, 2.1 years, 2.2 years, etc). With this in hand, you can now plot the worst return as a function of the horizon:

Here are a few observations that are apparent. First, Bitcoin's volatility for short holding periods can lead to big losses, north of 75% of invested capital. That is the volatility that captures almost all attention in the financial press. What they don't realize is that volatility has both downside and upside. The upside appears on the right half of the graph, where Bitcoin's returns steadily increase, peaking at 150% per year if held for the full 13-year horizon, from January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2024.

Second, the graph is not monotonic. It does not steadily increase but has peaks and valleys. For example, Bitcoin's worst return crosses 0% first at 3.25 years, again at four and a half years, and finally at over five years. So after 5.09 years, no one would have lost money by investing in Bitcoin, since the worst return is a lower bound on their payoff. After 5.86 years, Bitcoin would return at least the stock market’s historical return of 8%. After 6.08 years, Bitcoin would return at least Warren Buffett's historical return of around 22%. And after a little more than 10 years, Bitcoin will have returned more than 50% annually, greater than nearly all other investments.

Now let’s compare Bitcoin against other assets:

Bitcoin vs. Other Assets
PrinciplesofBitcoin.com

While the worst return from holding the S&P 500 is positive after around three years, it never really takes off. You can see the greater volatility of Bitcoin, but also the higher returns. SPY
Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust
looks very safe in comparison, but that safety comes at a price.

This graph shows the volatility of Bitcoin in a new light. The worst returns from other assets like gold, real estate, and bonds are (a) similar to each other, and (b) nearly flat compared to Bitcoin. It's true that other assets may not lead to large initial losses, but they also do not lead to longer-term gains. By way of comparison, the worst return from the S&P 500 exceeds 0% after 3.61 years, and 8% after 9.85 years. Similarly, it takes gold 12.38 years to escape breakeven in its worst case. This graph also gives the best indication that Bitcoin really is a new kind of investment. Notice how stocks, bonds, and real estate cluster together, while Bitcoin is markedly different.

What about a basket of tech stocks? Here are the worst returns of Bitcoin against those of Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia from January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2024:

Bitcoin vs. Big Tech
PrinciplesofBitcoin.com

Compared to the previous chart, the top tech stocks look more like Bitcoin, with larger losses for small holding periods and bigger gains for longer holding periods. It takes 4.23 years for Apple to guarantee a return of 0% and 6.83 years to exceed a return of 8%. It takes Tesla 5.71 years exceed break even, and it takes 6.21 years for Tesla to beat the historical stock market return of 8%.

Finally, here is Bitcoin against 9 large companies

Bitcoin vs. Top Stocks
PrinciplesofBitcoin.com

Even if you had bought Bitcoin at the highest possible price and sold it at the lowest possible price, you would have eclipsed the worst return from all other stocks after year 10.

The Value of Scarcity

The graphs illustrate the value of scarcity. A bare economic logic governs the price of Bitcoin: the supply is fixed and predictable, while demand has increased. There is no other way for price to respond but to go up.

You may think, however, that all of this rests on social consensus: people want Bitcoin because they believe it to be valuable. That is true, but there is an important feedback loop here. The fixed supply is what makes it valuable, which in turn drives price up, which then attracts new buyers, which in turn increases demand, which then causes price to increase again, and so on. The fixed supply is existential for this feedback loop to occur. And that fixed supply is what is missing from all other investments, such as fiat currencies, gold, and real estate. So we may not have exactly returns of this same magnitude in the future, I cannot believe that the underlying forces at play will simply vanish altogether.

The analysis here is a snippet of a longer research paper on worst-case analysis that I'm writing for an academic audience. Bitcoin motivated this problem, but a worst-case metric can apply to any investment. All the data in the analysis above comes from publicly available resources, such as SPY for the S&P 500 and ETFs like GLD
SPDR Gold Shares
for tracking the return from gold. This is part of a longer project for worst-case returns. Subscribe to the paid version of this newsletter to see the full analysis, including the code for the computations.

                                    Kamala Harris has seen her betting odds shrink over Donald Trump to a razor-thin margin with less than a month to go before November’s election.

The vice president’s lead over the former president has significantly narrowed to a single point as bets surge in favor of Trump, according to the Election Betting Odds tracker.

Bookmakers now give Harris a 50.1 percent chance of winning the race for the White House, while Trump is close behind on 49.1 percent. 

Last week, Harris was leading by 3.5 points.

The tracker works by consolidating betting numbers from five major markets – Betfair, Smarkets, PredictIt, Polymarket, and Kalshi.

Out of the five bookies, crypto-based betting platform Polymarket has given Trump’s odds of winning a boost, predicting he is now the slight favorite at 51.1 percent to Harris’s 48.3 percent.

The platform has also increased Trump’s odds of winning the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. Bookmakers give him a 55.5 percent chance of victory in the state compared to a 49 percent chance last week.

Other bookmakers give Harris a slight lead over Trump. On Kalshi, bookies put Harris ahead at 51 percent compared to Trump’s 49 percent. On PredictIt, the VP has 54 cents per share, which roughly equates to a 54 percent chance of winning, compared to 50 cents per share for Trump.

And, the British betting site Smarkets predicts Harris has a 50.5 percent chance of taking the White House compared to Trump, whose odds are 48 percent.

The polls, meanwhile, are incredibly close. The vice president currently has a 2.7-point lead over Trump in the latest average of national polls, collated by FiveThirtyEight.

On average, Harris has been marginally ahead of Trump in national polls for several weeks. In the key battleground states, the polls are almost neck-and-neck. 

Harris is ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania – but only just, according to the New York Times. Trump, meanwhile, has narrow leads in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.

In better news for Harris, Trump’s lead in his home state of Florida has dwindled, putting it in play for the vice president, a poll suggests.

The former president now leads Harris by just two percentage points in the Sunshine State, home to his Mar-a-Lago residence, according to a Thursday survey by Napolitan News Service conducted by RMG Research, which has historically favored Republicans.

There appears to be a stark age divide in the poll’s findings. While Harris has a stark lead among young Floridians, with 55 per cent of those polled supporting the Democratic presidential nominee to just 43 per cent supporting Trump, the former president leads significantly with the older crowd. 

More than half (53 per cent) of those aged 65 and older expressed backing Trump compared to 44 percent backing Harris.

                                    If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might’ve seen a banner featuring a ton of gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website taken over hackers to .

According to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4, on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring “Our new LEGO Coin is officially out!” Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven’t been any other attempts to bring back the banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you’re worried about that, Engadget confirmed clicking that banner’s “buy now” link takes you to the collection.

How did this happen? LEGO isn’t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been “swiftly resolved.” More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during this time, and that customers “can continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.”

Despite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn’t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure you’re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.
