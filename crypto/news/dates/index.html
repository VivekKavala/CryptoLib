                                    Kamala Harris has seen her betting odds shrink over Donald Trump to a razor-thin margin with less than a month to go before November’s election.

The vice president’s lead over the former president has significantly narrowed to a single point as bets surge in favor of Trump, according to the Election Betting Odds tracker.

Bookmakers now give Harris a 50.1 percent chance of winning the race for the White House, while Trump is close behind on 49.1 percent. 

Last week, Harris was leading by 3.5 points.

The tracker works by consolidating betting numbers from five major markets – Betfair, Smarkets, PredictIt, Polymarket, and Kalshi.

Out of the five bookies, crypto-based betting platform Polymarket has given Trump’s odds of winning a boost, predicting he is now the slight favorite at 51.1 percent to Harris’s 48.3 percent.

The platform has also increased Trump’s odds of winning the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. Bookmakers give him a 55.5 percent chance of victory in the state compared to a 49 percent chance last week.

Other bookmakers give Harris a slight lead over Trump. On Kalshi, bookies put Harris ahead at 51 percent compared to Trump’s 49 percent. On PredictIt, the VP has 54 cents per share, which roughly equates to a 54 percent chance of winning, compared to 50 cents per share for Trump.

And, the British betting site Smarkets predicts Harris has a 50.5 percent chance of taking the White House compared to Trump, whose odds are 48 percent.

The polls, meanwhile, are incredibly close. The vice president currently has a 2.7-point lead over Trump in the latest average of national polls, collated by FiveThirtyEight.

On average, Harris has been marginally ahead of Trump in national polls for several weeks. In the key battleground states, the polls are almost neck-and-neck. 

Harris is ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania – but only just, according to the New York Times. Trump, meanwhile, has narrow leads in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.

In better news for Harris, Trump’s lead in his home state of Florida has dwindled, putting it in play for the vice president, a poll suggests.

The former president now leads Harris by just two percentage points in the Sunshine State, home to his Mar-a-Lago residence, according to a Thursday survey by Napolitan News Service conducted by RMG Research, which has historically favored Republicans.

There appears to be a stark age divide in the poll’s findings. While Harris has a stark lead among young Floridians, with 55 per cent of those polled supporting the Democratic presidential nominee to just 43 per cent supporting Trump, the former president leads significantly with the older crowd. 

More than half (53 per cent) of those aged 65 and older expressed backing Trump compared to 44 percent backing Harris.

                                    If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might’ve seen a banner featuring a ton of gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website taken over hackers to .

According to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4, on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring “Our new LEGO Coin is officially out!” Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven’t been any other attempts to bring back the banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you’re worried about that, Engadget confirmed clicking that banner’s “buy now” link takes you to the collection.

How did this happen? LEGO isn’t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been “swiftly resolved.” More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during this time, and that customers “can continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.”

Despite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn’t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure you’re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.

                            FBI warns users of fake cryptocurrency platform ICHCoin and believes there's more victims

                                    HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The FBI is looking to identify additional victims of a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform that has taken millions of dollars from people across the U.S. FBI Houston's Assistant Special Agent in Charge Amanda Culver called ICHCoin both a "scheme" and a "scam." She said it starts with someone reaching out to the victims on social media, including Instagram or Facebook, and asking if the recipient wants to learn more about investing in cryptocurrency. She said the profiles reaching out are fake. The victims are then directed to WhatsApp to communicate with individuals claiming to teach them. From there, Culver said that people are urged to lie to their banks about the large wire transfer from the account to ICHCoin. According to the FBI, the victims can track the return on their investments on an ICHCoin app, but ultimately, there is no return on the investment. Culver said when the victims try to collect their money from the platform, they are ghosted and cannot get their money back. Throughout the investigation, the FBI found people who had lost their entire life savings on the fraudulent platform. "The average person could certainly be fooled by this scam," Culver said. ABC13 asked Culver if the person or persons behind it were in the U.S. or abroad, and she said they were working to find out. "I think it's important for people to know that any time you receive unsolicited messages from people asking you to invest, promising high rates of return on your investment, telling you that they're going to give you free money for you to invest, anything along those lines, those are red flags," Culver explained. "We want to make sure the word is out there that these fake platforms exist." Since December 2023, the FBI has found that approximately $30 million in the U.S. has been lost to the platform. "It is extremely easy to use these platforms to bamboozle people," Culver said. "It's a whole new world for folks. People are very interested in investing in cryptocurrency, and crypto is one of those platforms on which folks recognize that there can be a return on investment. The concern is that homework needs to be done." They have already identified victims of ICHCoin in Houston but are looking to hear more from them. Anyone who believes they have fallen victim can answer the questionnaire on the FBI's website. For more on this story, follow Mycah Hatfield on Facebook, X and Instagram.

                                    After rolling out the first slate of international dates in support of her upcoming Tension II album last month, Australian pop superstar Kylie Minogue announced the North American leg of the outing on Thursday (Oct. 3). The 2025 Tension Tour is slated to kick off on March 29 with a gig at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto and take the “Padam Padam” singer to Montreal, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Austin, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver and Denver before winding down with a May 2 show at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Tickets for Minogue’s biggest tour since 2011 will kick off with an American Express presale for card members on Oct. 8 at 10 a.m. local time (through Oct. 10 at 10 p.m. local time), followed by an artist presale starting on Oct. 9 at 10 a.m., which fans can sign up for now here. The general public onsale will begin at 10 a.m. local on Oct. 11. “I am beyond excited to announce the TENSION TOUR 2025. I can’t wait to share beautiful and wild moments with fans all over the world, celebrating the Tension era and more! It’s been an exhilarating ride so far and now, get ready for your close up because I will be calling Lights, Camera, Action … and there will be a whole lot of Padaming!,” Minogue said in a statement. The 13-track Tension II album, led by the first single “Lights Camera Action,” was released last month, featuring the previously-released dance song “Edge of Saturday Night” with The Blessed Madonna as well as collaborations with Orville Peck, Bebe Rexha and Tove Lo, and Sia. The North American dates will follow on the heels of the Australian leg that launches with a Feb. 15 show at Perth’s RAC Arena, marking her first home country gig in five years.
