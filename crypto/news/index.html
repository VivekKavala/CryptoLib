                    How badly was the Indian crypto investor community hit by the $230 million WazirX hack?
                </h3>

                            Harsh Gupta, 19, was so fascinated by cryptocurrency that he started trading on the Indian crypto exchange WazirX. He initially used his mother’s name to set up the account because he was a minor. Later, he set up his own account. When a WazirX wallet was exploited on July 18, Gupta had about ₹60,000 in his WazirX account, and another ₹18,000 in the WazirX account under his mother’s name. Gupta admitted that he wasn’t really affected by the hack as the amount locked in WazirX was only a small percentage of his investments. Still, he was upset for the many WazirX users who lost lakhs of rupees or even their life savings; he wanted to urgently raise awareness about their plight. “Many people I know can’t live a normal life now, they can’t eat, they can’t sleep. They are now living in a constant misery and have no clarity of what will happen to their money,” Gupta told The Hindu in an email, adding, “WazirX has no rights to hold on to their user funds. I know some people who can’t pay the hospital bills to treat their family member suffering from cancer.” Gupta believes the WazirX hack is actually a scam. While some WazirX customers have tried filing cyber police complaints, Gupta felt these attempts were not taken seriously by the authorities. As one of India’s largest crypto exchanges, WazirX had over four million users holding crypto, out of its userbase of around 16 million. On July 18, one of its digital wallets - managed with another company called Liminal - was breached, and the exchange was slow in updating its users. It did not provide detailed reports about the lost assets, and then indefinitely stopped customers from withdrawing their crypto. WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty next claimed that he could not compensate users with the company’s profits, because it had been sold to the international crypto exchange Binance years ago. As WazirX users reeled in shock, Binance strongly denied this claim and said that its ownership dispute with the Indian exchange had nothing to do with WazirX’s responsibility to its users. “As a result of WazirX’s actions, including their reversal on decisions to delist certain cryptocurrencies and their failure to maintain transparent communication with users, I incurred losses totaling over INR 15 lakhs,” Shiva Kumar Shivaraju, another WazirX account holder, told The Hindu. His issues with the platform started even before the hack. The 47-year-old IT consultant-turned-homestay owner in Karnataka said, “These errors and subsequent misleading emails have caused me immense mental distress, financial harm, and uncertainty about the safety of my investments.” He would like to see the Indian government better regulating the country’s crypto sector by establishing a dedicated regulatory body. Is history repeating itself? While embittered crypto traders live out an investor’s worst nightmare, WazirX pushed ahead with its plans to undergo restructuring in Singapore. The company announced that its operating entity Zettai would be applying for a moratorium. This was intended to obtain more time for the exchange, and to stop angry users from taking legal action of their own against the company. However, many WazirX users grew more anxious when the exchange introduced Kroll’s Jason Kardachi and George Gwee. That’s because Kroll was involved in the restructuring of another struggling crypto platform called Vauld, which suspended withdrawals in the summer of 2022 due to market conditions. In response to The Hindu’s email to the Vauld Action organisation, a group of over 20 people from different countries, identifying themselves as Vauld creditors, stated that they were deeply unhappy with Kroll’s actions and the restructuring process. “We Vauld creditors have been repeatedly lied to, deceived, avoided, and have had our funds drained by excessive costs. The Vauld scheme of arrangement contains creditor unfriendly provisions which give us creditors very little power. At the same time, the scheme protects Kroll and Vauld and provides them maximum power,” wrote multiple Vauld customers in their emails, citing a common statement. Others shared how much money they had lost and called the restructuring process a “disaster” or a “catastrophe.” Some users claimed that the recovered funds were far less than what they invested, while others said their assets were still stuck on the platform. Now, numerous WazirX users are afraid they will face similar treatment. As WazirX’s customers took to X (formerly Twitter) to express their frustration, CEO Shetty posted Ganesh Chaturthi wishes and advised his followers to turn to God. Victims unite and govern themselves ‘Justice for WazirX Users,’ an X account run by the handle @IndiasCrypto, is bringing together affected victims in order to file a police complaint against WazirX and CEO Shetty. The account’s owner identified themselves as a “sailor” who lost money in the hack, and said their community had 4,500 victims and a Telegram group with 1,800 victims. Approximately 60 had filed online cyber complaints against WazirX, according to them. “The reaction from WazirX management has been disappointing. Their handling of the situation seems more focused on buying time rather than providing real solutions. The way the hack occurred raises multiple questions about whether it was genuinely a hack or an insider job,” the ‘Justice for WazirX Users’ account administrator told The Hindu in a message on X, adding, “It’s troubling that our fate is being decided by a foreign jurisdiction.” In the short term, the group is looking to file a criminal complaint as well as a PIL in the Supreme Court. Others are reportedly taking their case to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to seek recovery of their funds. “However, many of the users affected are from middle class families and fear the complexities and repercussions of filing a police complaint. We are also exploring options to escalate the issue with relevant authorities and regulatory bodies to ensure that a fair investigation takes place,” said the ‘Justice for WazirX Users’ account admin. Post-hack learnings and regret While Indian crypto investors are often cast as shady characters or dark web users, the reality is that many WazirX investors who are struggling today chose the company because it was a centralised crypto exchange that repeatedly declared it was compliant with Indian regulations. IT professional, Mayank Bhatodra, 33, has been using WazirX since 2019 but is also a stock trader with market knowledge. He trusted WazirX because it carried out KYC (Know-Your-Customer) documentation and the transactions took place in Indian rupees. Bhatodra was upset that WazirX had locked up his holdings after the hack. “In a market as volatile as cryptocurrency, locking users’ funds for an extended period is extremely risky. WazirX should feel the pain that users are experiencing and take steps to fix this situation responsibly. We trusted WazirX as an Indian exchange, and they should not pass the responsibility onto others while leaving users to suffer,” he told The Hindu by email. What comes next? WazirX’s users have one thing in common: they are filled with questions. How was more than $230 million actually lost? Who really owns WazirX? Why were the users’ unhacked assets frozen? How long will investors have to wait to access their own funds? Why isn’t WazirX compensating customers? Will WazirX users be treated like Vauld’s investors? And finally: why isn’t the Indian government coming to investors’ aid, when it taxes their crypto gains? Time is running out. WazirX announced on September 26 that a four-month-long moratorium had been granted by the Singapore courts. But crypto prices can crash in a matter of minutes, wiping out billions of dollars in value from the market. While other traders rush to collect profits or minimise their losses, WazirX investors can only watch in despair. “Now that the hack has happened, I am left asking: why is WazirX forcing its users to bear all the losses? Many of us already purchased crypto at higher prices, and with the market being volatile, our portfolios are already down by 50% or more,” pointed out Bhatodra. “This is devastating for Indian investors.” Those in distress or having suicidal tendencies can seek help and counselling by calling these helplines.

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Bitcoin prices took a tumble earlier as investors responded to the latest geopolitical developments. ... [+] (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Getty Images Bitcoin prices plunged today, dropping to nearly $60,000 after global investors responded to the latest developments signaling rising tensions in the Middle East. The world’s most prominent digital currency fell to roughly $60,150 in the late afternoon, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency had declined close to 9% since reaching more than $66,000 roughly 48 hours earlier, and was trading at its lowest value since approximately September 18, additional Coinbase figures offered by TradingView reveal. Stocks also tumbled. At the time of this writing, the benchmark S&P 500 was down close to 1% for the day, according to Google Finance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index containing 30 stocks, had fallen 0.41%, additional Google Finance figures reveal. Brent futures contracts, on the other hand, pushed higher, rising around 2.6% to settle above $73, according to Reuters. When explaining these latest price movements, several analysts highlighted the recent geopolitical turmoil that has taken place in the Middle East. Earlier today, Iran attacked Israel, launching dozens of missiles at crucial targets in the latter nation, according to Al Jazeera.

Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, offered a similar assessment. “Hello Charles, today’s price action seems to be dominated by the situation in the Middle East,” he said via Telegram. “It also hit the stock market and oil (to the upside),” Moreno added. While the aforementioned analysts focused on geopolitical developments, another analyst took a different view. “This drop is a bit of a strange one,” Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, stated through email. “Part of the reason is due to end-of-month profit taking, especially after a month which has historically been the worst for BTC and other tokens; part is due to options expiring, again at the end of the month; and part is due to BTC being overbought, especially in relation to other tokens as BTC dominance hit a yearly high,” he clarified. “In short, it’s a bit of a breather after an unexpectedly solid month,” Enneking added.

                            Almost $10 million in cryptocurrency has been seized from a man accused of masterminding an encrypted messaging network used to plan drug deals and murders. Jay Je Yoon Jung, 32, was arrested at his parents' Sydney home in September, accused of creating and maintaining a secret communications app and network known as "Ghost". Analysis of devices seized during his arrest later allowed investigators to break into an account holding cryptocurrency, and transfer it to the Australian Federal Police after they deciphered his "seed phrase" for access. Authorities will seek to have the cryptocurrency, worth $9.3 million, forfeited to the Commonwealth, investigators said on Wednesday. Jung has been charged with numerous offences including supporting a criminal organisation and dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime. He is also accused of subscribing to cryptocurrency wallets using fake identities and not complying with evidence access orders. Jung allegedly distributed modified smartphones for about $2350, including a six-month subscription to the encrypted network. The deal allegedly included regular software updates, which ended up being the network's downfall after police "infected" the devices and began monitoring communications. Jung remains in custody to return to court in November. Police had the power to target people seeking illegal profits, AFP acting Commander Scott Raven said. "Whether you have tried to hide them in real estate, cryptocurrency or cash, we will identify your ill-gotten goods and take them away from you, leaving you with nothing," he said. The multimillion-dollar seizure was the second asset restraint stemming from the operation targeting the Ghost network, after a Perth man had cryptocurrency and properties worth about $2 million restrained in August. His declared taxable income and expenditure was "grossly out of proportion" to the value of the restrained assets, the AFP said. Police have so far arrested 46 people as part of the operation targeting those allegedly behind the Ghost platform and using it to facilitate crimes. A 47-year-old man arrested during raids in September is due to return to court in Sydney on Thursday on charges of possessing a dedicated encrypted criminal communication device to facilitate serious criminal activity and failing to comply with an evidence access order. Police allege he helped distribute the Ghost platform and would arrange for encrypted handsets to be delivered to buyers via "dead drops" in exchange for payment. Two phones seized at his southwest Sydney home were allegedly dedicated for use on the platform, but the man refused to provide investigators with information that would help them access the devices.

                    AI replaces Web3 as hot key word in Hong Kong’s FinTech Week
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Artificial intelligence is expected to outshine Web3 at this year’s FinTech Week, which kicks off at the end of the month, as organisers InvestHK and Finoverse tease a slate of mainland Chinese exhibitors looking to ride the generative AI wave. “[There is] a huge increase in mainland Chinese companies’ representation at this year’s event … [and a] big, big focus on AI and advanced technologies,” said Anthony Sar, founder and CEO of Finoverse. “AI, especially driven a lot by China tech, is one of the prominent trends that’s very different.” Two years ago, Hong Kong used FinTech Week to focus on a regulatory overhaul meant to turn the city into a virtual asset hub. One of the headlining speakers was FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried, who is now serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud. Since then, multiple challenges have emerged, including a cryptocurrency market downturn – partially triggered by the 2022 collapse of FTX – major frauds in Hong Kong, and a regulatory regime for exchanges that some have criticised as too strict to stimulate business activity. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT has led to AI projects sucking up much of the technology industry’s attention. FinTech Week is adapting to the times. The focus has turned towards Hong Kong’s role as a “connector” between international business and China, the world’s second-largest AI market behind the US. This year’s conference, which runs from October 28 to November 1, will bring some participants across the border to Shenzhen to visit companies in China’s southern technology hub, including the offices of SenseTime, Tencent Holdings and ByteDance. Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Post owner Alibaba Group Holding, is sponsoring the event for the first time this year, and CEO Eric Jing is one of the high-profile speakers. Representatives from Tencent, Xiaomi, JD.com and SenseTime will also be there. “At the end of the day, it’s all about connecting to international markets. Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and so on,” said King Leung, global head of financial services at InvestHK, the Hong Kong government’s investment promotion arm. “The one thing that I think we have to appreciate is that Hong Kong is just a lot of regional, international headquarters of different financial institutions.” This presents an opportunity for AI firms that come to the city to pitch a proof of concept to these institutions and then offer to set up similar solutions in other markets, according to Leung. As Hong Kong seeks to maintain its status as Asia’s finance hub, AI has proven to have commercial applicability in a way blockchain has not. Many blockchain projects in financial institutions have either fizzled out or stagnated. Meanwhile, companies are racing to integrate generative AI into their services by helping with things such as regulatory compliance and investment advice. The organisers say there is no doubt that a lot of attention has shifted to AI, but Web3 remains a key part of the show. “We want to highlight the fact that there’s a big presence of Chinese companies, but it’s not limited to that,” Sar said. FinTech Week’s shine for Web3 players has not worn off yet. There are more speakers at this year’s event with a background in Web3 than in AI. Most of the roughly 130 speakers come from a traditional finance background. The organisers argued that it will still take time for Web3 to take off, noting that many of the major players are still building out infrastructure. “Over the past two years, since the policy announcement, we have seen mid-to-high double-digit growth in this segment,” King said. “These are world-class companies, but because they are more like infrastructure people, that’s why they are not able to attract as much attention.” King said a 1996 quote from Bill Gates illustrates what is happening in Web3: “People often overestimate what will happen in the next two years and underestimate what will happen in 10.” As the FinTech Week organisers look ahead to next year, when the event will celebrate its tenth anniversary, they are also thinking about how the show’s priorities reflect Hong Kong’s role as a place to experiment. In the future, the event may not be about blockchain or AI, but whatever is next. “What we are seeing now is very, very clear, [which] is that Hong Kong will become the sort of macro sandbox for frontier technologies,” King said. “FinTech Week can potentially become so much like the incubation platform for a lot of these global frontier technologies firms to congregate in Hong Kong, sell to the financial services sector, then grow to other parts of the world.” FinTech Week 2024 still a magnet for Web3 figures Speaker Organisation Role Areas of focus Ashutosh Goel xalts Founder, CEO Web3 Chan Tak Lam Norman Institute of Web3.0 Hong Kong Founding chairman Web3 David E.

                            Bitcoin fell to $60,000 on Tuesday evening as tensions in the Middle East worsened due to Iran’s attack on Israel. The leading cryptocurrency dropped nearly 5%, trading at $60,834. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which had been outperforming Bitcoin just days prior, saw a steeper decline, plunging over 6% to hover around $2,450. The sharp sell-off in the crypto market mirrors the negative sentiment that gripped the broader financial markets on Tuesday following Iran’s attack on Israel. The geopolitical uncertainty has rattled investors, leading to a widespread risk-off approach. Other major cryptocurrencies also took a hit, with Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin falling by over 8%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. As a result, the global cryptocurrency market cap dropped 4.7% to $2.14 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The market’s volatility underscores the broader impact of geopolitical events on investor confidence across asset classes, particularly within the more speculative crypto space. Crypto ETFs have mixed results Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and spot Ether ETFs had mixed outcomes. According to ETF tracker Farside, while spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced inflows in the past week, spot Ether ETFs saw a mix of inflows and outflows. Investors will keep an eye on the trend in the coming days following the Fed’s interest rate cut and the escalating tension in the Middle East.

                    Robinhood launches crypto transfers in Europe as it pushes overseas expansion
                </h3>

                            Retail investing platform Robinhood on Tuesday announced that it’s offering customers in Europe the ability to transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of its app, broadening its product capabilities in the region as it presses ahead with international expansion. In a blog post on Tuesday, the company said that it’ll allow customers in the European Union to deposit and withdraw more than 20 digital currencies through its platform, including bitcoin, ethereum, solana, and USD coin. The move effectively gives Robinhood’s European users the ability to “self-custody” assets — meaning that, rather than entrusting your cryptocurrency to a third-party platform, you can instead take ownership of it in a fully owned wallet that holds your funds. In December last year, Robinhood launched its crypto trading service, Robinhood Crypto, in the EU for the first time. The service allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but not to move them away from the platform, either to another third-party platform or to their own self-custodial wallet. Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood’s crypto unit, told CNBC that he thinks the EU has the potential to become an attractive market for digital currencies, thanks to crypto-friendly regulations being adopted by the bloc. “The EU can become a very attractive market next year,” Kerbrat said in an interview. He pointed to the EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), regulation, which sets out harmonized rules for the crypto sector across all 27 of the bloc’s member states. Once MiCA is fully in place, Kerbrat said, every EU country will fall under the same unified regime. “In terms of total addressable market, [the EU] is as big as the U.S.,” he told CNBC, adding, “it’s definitely an interesting market for us.” Robinhood added that, for a limited time, the company will offer European customers the ability to get 1% of the value of tokens deposited on its platform back in the form of the equivalent cryptocurrency they transfer into Robinhood. Robinhood is rolling out new features in the EU at a time when U.S. crypto firms are sparring with regulators at home. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued several companies including Coinbase, Binance and Ripple over claims that they’re all dealing in unregistered securities.

                            With less than 35 days until the U.S. presidential election, the crypto industry seems to be hoping for more favorable regulations in the near future. At Messari’s annual Mainnet conference in New York City, Shan Aggarwal, the vice president of corporate and business development at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) Ventures, touched on the industry’s regulatory uncertainties. “We’re hoping for the best,” he said in an exclusive interview with Quartz. His remarks highlight the sector’s anticipation that the coming election could lead to clearer, more supportive legislation. “The current SEC, it’s hard to go down from here,” Aggarwal said. “[Gary Gensler] has taken a regulation-by-enforcement approach towards the entire crypto industry, including Coinbase.” Aggarwal is scheduled to speak at the conference Wednesday, where he will discuss Coinbase’s investments, mergers, and acquisitions over the years, as well as its future strategic direction. This year, Coinbase partnered with traditional financial giants such as BlackRock to offer a platform for the tokenization of funds. Of that collaboration, Aggarwal said, “Coinbase acts as the bridge between traditional finance and crypto that touches different customer segments including retail customers, institutions, businesses.” Mainnet conference is about the future of crypto Messari is a leading provider of market intelligence for the crypto and Web3 sectors. Its three-day conference brings together prominent crypto leaders, investors, and industry professionals to explore the rising trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and integrating traditional financial instruments on blockchain — a signal of decentralized technologies moving toward mainstream adoption. This year, Messari made headlines when CEO Ryan Selkis resigned after a series of controversial tweets about U.S. immigrants, violence toward Trump opponents, and civil war. During 2021’s Mainnet event, the SEC served two subpoenas to the speaker of the event, Terraform Labs founder and then-CEO Do Kwon. Kwon, once a crypto king, was arrested in March 2023 for forging travel documents while trying to flee Montenegro. He is currently awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea, where he faces potential charges. Messari launches AI-powered assistant for crypto At this year’s conference, Messari introduced Messari Copilot, an AI assistant designed for the crypto industry. This tool delivers text-based answers to user queries based on Messari’s research and data, providing a comprehensive view of the crypto landscape.

                    Spy style 'dead drops' and millions in crypto: AFP allegations against Ghost app hierarchy

                            The Australian Federal Police will allege in court that it has restrained $9.3 million in cryptocurrency from Jay Je Yoon Jung – the alleged creator of the app Ghost – which they allege was created solely for the use of criminal organisations. The AFP says it has also arrested another man they allege distributed the app for Mr Jung. The announcement comes two weeks after the AFP arrested the 32-year-old Mr Jung at his Narwee home and spent days searching the property, which included the seizure of multiple digital devices. The AFP will allege that an analytics specialist from the AFP's Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce deciphered Mr Jung's cryptocurrency account's "seed phrase". A seed phrase is a recovery tool created by a user that uses words to grant access to funds as a last resort. The AFP says it has transferred the funds into a secure account. Tom Uren is a cyber security expert and author of the cyber security policy newsletter Seriously Risky Business. He told 7.30 that better equipped authorities are now routinely infiltrating software as part of their investigations. The AFP alleges Mr Jung created the 'Ghost' app when he was 23 years old and designed it to be exclusively used by the underworld to organise high-level criminal activity. Mr Jung has since been charged with five offences, including supporting a criminal organisation. Spy techniques on display A "close associate" of alleged 'Ghost' app mastermind Jay Je Yoon Jung is accused of being an alleged distributor of the platform, selling to customers in the criminal underworld. The AFP will allege 47-year-old Mandat Lieu arranged for encrypted handsets to be delivered to buyers – which includes major criminal syndicates – through "dead drops" for payment. These "dead drops" allegedly involved Mr Lieu organising a rendezvous point for customers to pick up the devices without being seen together. The AFP alleges that Mr Jung created a business model that involved selling handsets installed with his app for $2,345, which included a six-month subscription. Mr Lieu's Greenacre house was tactically entered by AFP officers and searched by AFP in the early hours of September 18. Police seized $17,400 in cash, eight mobile phones, three laptops, 23 SIM cards and 15 other communication devices and encrypted USBs. The AFP alleges Mr Lieu refused to provide investigators with access to two mobile phones found in his bedroom, believed to be GhostECC dedicated encrypted communications devices. "It's actually a lucrative business on its own, because the criminals are willing to pay a lot of money for what they think are secure communications," Mr Uren said. The 47-year-old was charged with failing to comply with an order and possessing a dedicated encrypted criminal communication device to facilitate serious criminal activity. He will face Sydney Downing Centre Local Court today. Operation Kraken The AFP has been able to track messages sent on Ghost since March, with officers tracking 125,000 messages sent between criminals. The force's 'resolution phase' launched on September 17 which involved dozens of raids being executed across the country, targeting alleged users of the platform. There have been 46 arrests so far, 30 firearms seized and $2.37 million in cash located. Mr Uren says in investigations like this one officers tend to arrest the "important people" first and that it could take months or even years before they prosecute the "lower ranking people". He says these types of operations have given the AFP the ability to uncover "who some of the higher up kingpins are, who they weren't even aware of".
