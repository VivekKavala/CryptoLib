                    'A New Way Forward': Harris-Walz Economic Plan Includes Digital Assets

                            Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have released the outline of how they will boost the economy should they win the November elections, and notably, the economic playbook mentions digital assets.The 80-page plan published Wednesday on the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign website provides an in-depth look at the duo's vision for the U.S. economy, including their plans for manufacturing, taxes, and the cryptocurrency industry, albeit on a less-detailed scale.A Plan Designed to Keep US Edge In 'Industries of the Future'The Harris-Walz economic playbook is titled A New Way Forward for the Middle Class: A Plan to Lower Costs and Create and Opportunity Economy." Somewhere in the middle, the Democratic duo outlined how they will "sharpen America's edge in sectors that are critical for our economic and national security."The presidential and vice-presidential candidates floated an "America Forward strategy" that should trigger a new era in American industry by encouraging growth in manufacturing and deploying new technologies.The said strategy will focus not just on "clean iron and steel" but also on "emerging technologies" that they believe are essential to maintain a future where the United States remains competitive in the global technological space."Their strategy includes both investing in emerging technologies and modernizing traditional industries. It will also encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors," the playbook noted.Digital assets were mentioned once throughout the plan, and there were no further details about how exactly Harris and Walz are planning to encourage crypto technology. There were also no specific details about the extent of investments a Harris-Walz administration will pour into the emerging industry.Backing First Ever Statements on Crypto?The economic playbook's mention of digital assets is very much the same as Kamala's comments when she publicly spoke about crypto for the first time during a fundraiser in Manhattan a few days back.She promised to encourage innovative technologies, including digital assets while ensuring consumer protection. She also said she will unite key players and huge investors to "invest in America's competitiveness, to invest in America's future."Her comments then drew mixed reactions from cryptocurrency users.Crypto Community Demands More DetailsOn The Chain podcast co-founder Chip commented on the economic plan, saying Harris and Walz should be more specific on how they will actually "encourage" innovative technologies. He said Kamala's statements then and now were "definitely something [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary] Gensler would say."Ripple Payments software engineer Neil Hartner had similar thoughts, saying the use of digital assets on the Harris-Walz economic plan were "sufficiently ambiguous."Multiple other crypto users and enthusiasts shared the same sentiments regarding the lack of clarity in the Democratic frontrunners' plan for the digital assets space.Others Give Harris a ChanceOn the other hand, other crypto advocates believe Harris has made progress in her positions toward emerging technologies. Prominent analyst Adam Cochran noted how, on Wednesday, Harris mentioned "blockchain" in the list of innovative technologies that she believes the U.S. should remain "dominant" in.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, said the mention of digital assets in the Harris-Walz economic plan is "an encouraging step forward."It remains to be seen whether Harris or Walz will soon talk in more detail about their plans for blockchain, digital assets, and more specifically, crypto, but with less than two months left before the elections, most crypto voters are asking for a clear and targeted stance.

                    “2024 Election Sees Significant Spending by ‘Crypto Bros'”
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Back in Holland in the 1600s the market went wild for tulips — and then crashed in a spectacular fashion. As Syracuse law professor Christian Day wrote, “when the markets crashed … society often rejoiced in schadenfreude.” Today the craze is crypto. And one of the reasons to take this more seriously than Tulip Mania is that cryptocurrency companies — and their evangelistic boosters, often referred to as “crypto bros” — are spending big money in the 2024 elections to influence American voters. As I write about in my book “Corporatocracy,” cryptocurrency spending in American elections isn’t completely novel. Back in 2020, the largest single corporate donation to a super PAC was a $5 million donation from a company called Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund run by the then-wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried, better known as SBF. At the time I had never heard of Alameda. That would certainly change after his crypto currency FTX imploded in late 2022. It turned out that these companies (Alameda and FTX) were joined at the hip, with money flowing back and forth between them through a back door, and that FTX was acting like a bank without a banking license in any of the countries where it operated — including the U.S. “We know that FTX’s affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research made large bets that fared poorly, leaving Alameda with a dubious balance sheet (its largest asset was its holdings of FTT tokens),” law professor Hillary Allen said in written testimony to the Senate in December 2022. “We know that assets belonging to FTX’s customers were lent to Alameda, in exchange for FTT tokens. We know that FTX created these FTT tokens out of nothing … When unlimited assets can be created, there are no limits on the creation of leverage, and when assets have no fundamentals and trade entirely on sentiment, traditional checks on fraud (like valuation methodologies and financial accounting) will inevitably break down.” What I knew as a campaign finance expert was that FTX/Alameda spent big in the 2022 election. On the record, Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest campaign spenders in the midterm election to the tune of $40 million, nearly all of it supporting Democratic candidates and causes. But that was just the money he spent on the record. After he was arrested, SBF started talking to the press. He leaked the diary of his ex-girlfriend and co-defendant Caroline Ellison to the New York Times, and he told a reporter that he spent even more dark money in the election to support Republicans and Republican causes. And the Justice Department didn’t just charge SBF with securities fraud — it also charged him with making $100 million in illegal campaign contributions. This was illegal because of an old law called the Tillman Act from 1907 which bars corporations from giving their treasury funds directly to federal candidates. SBF received a 25-year sentence for his securities fraud and other charges, and Ellison, whose testimony is seen as having helped prosecutors win a conviction, has been sentenced to two years behind bars. In the end, SBF got off on a technicality for his campaign finance crimes because his extradition papers from the Bahamas didn’t mention campaign finance violations. The reason I think these crimes actually happened was because two of his fellow executives Ryan Salame and Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to help commit them. Salame got 90 months. Singh will be sentenced on Oct. 30. So what is the tech industry up to in the 2024 election? A lot. For one, Peter Theil’s candidate of choice, JD Vance — who Theil bankrolled in the 2022 Ohio senatorial race — is the vice-presidential nominee for the Republican Party. Elon Musk has a new PAC called America PAC that reportedly has spent $30 million. There are several all-crypto PACs, including Protect Progress PAC which has spent over $8 million, and Defend American Jobs PAC which has spent over $50 million. But the 800-pound gorilla is a PAC called Fairshake PAC, which has raised over $200 million and spent $100 million. Fairshake is funded by the Winklevoss twins, Mark Andreesen, and the company Coinbase. Company reps have already gloated about taking out Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, in her run for U.S. Senate in the Democratic primary, stating “Thank you, Katie Porter, for giving Fairshake credit for your loss.” (Protect Progress is the left-leaning affiliate of Fairshake and Defend American Jobs is its right-leaning affiliate.) Now Fairshake, through Defend American Jobs, has reportedly decided to spend $800,000 a day to target sitting Sen. Sherrod Brown, also a Democrat, who is the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee. These crypto PACs are a little different than most corporate PACs: most corporate money goes to support Republicans exclusively, but these crypto PACs support pro-crypto candidates whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Which then gets us to candidate Donald Trump’s obvious attempts to get this crypto money on his side. On Sept. 17, Trump and his sons launched a crypto exchange of their own, Trump has been selling NFTs, and he accepts Bitcoin donations. He has also said that he would pay the national debt with cryptocurrency and that poof it would be gone — an approach that has been met with derision, including from media commentator Nell Minow who wrote, “Why not just pay with Monopoly money?” As someone who watched SBF act as the big spender in the political strip club only to end up in handcuffs and decades in prison, I can only hope the new crop of political crypto-spenders get better campaign finance legal advice than SBF did. It’s pretty easy to lawfully spend corporate money in American elections since the Supreme Court’s 2020 Citizens United ruling, which significantly lifted restrictions on political spending. But if the new wave of crypto high rollers are reckless, they could end up in an adjoining cell next to SBF, who was a billionaire before he reached the age of 30.

                    Biden-Harris feds shut down solvent banks in an unconstitutional move against crypto banking
                </h3>

                            Many of you may remember my reporting around "Operation Choke Point 2.0" from the spring of 2023; TLDR, Biden's financial regulators, namely the Fed, FDIC, and OCC, launched a crackdown on banks covering the crypto space. The first casualty was Silvergate Bank, which voluntarily liquidated. The standard reporting around Silvergate was that the bank lent to crypto depositors and those depositors were flighty; when rates rose, Silvergate suffered M2M losses on bond portfolios and ended up insolvent. Except that's not true. Silvergate weathered the storm, even though short sellers and members of Congress like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) encouraged a bank run based on rumors that Silvergate had criminal exposure to FTX. The company has since been cleared of those allegations. They are targeting your livelihood and making it impossible for you to operate normally, by making banking inaccessible/expensive. Silvergate suffered massive redemptions after FTX but were still solvent and able to do business. However, there was one problem: The Fed told the bank that it had to reduce its crypto exposure to only a nominal ("ancillary") part of its business. This is like telling Dunkin’ Donuts that it can’t sell donuts or coffee. Silvergate was a boutique crypto bank that served the crypto industry. So after the Fed issued this new informal guidance, its business ceased to exist, and it voluntarily liquidated. The bank's assets were also toxic, as it became clear with Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate that any crypto-related lines of business would not be eligible to be sold, according to the OCC. This included SEN and Signet, as well as crypto deposits at those banks. I broke the story in two pieces in Pirate Wires in 2023, and since then, "Operation Choke Point 2.0" has become normalized in the discourse. One point I've endeavored to make is that Silvergate died by murder, not suicide. The critical point is that the Fed told Silvergate after the drawdown that it had to cut its crypto deposits to 15% of its book, dooming the bank. (This is obviously unconstitutional, by the way.) In my original reporting, I thought this was the FDIC, but it was actually the San Francisco Fed that was passing down this guidance. It had the same effect — killing pro-crypto banks and making crypto firms unable to get banking. Until now, we haven't had any evidence of the scandal at Silvergate beyond statements made by bank executives on background to journalists. Most of my reporting on OCP 2.0 has been corroborated hundreds of times over by folks affected. Still, the Silvergate stuff has remained a mystery since the bank has been in wind-down mode and has been settling with the SEC and so on. (There's another story here about the settlements, but that's for another day.) So what's new now is that Elaine Hetrick, former chief administrative officer of Silvergate, filed a declaration as part of Silvergate's Chapter 11 filings. For the first time, it completely corroborates what I wrote in my reporting. And it's all on the record. You can find it here. We have never had a Silvergate executive able to go on the record and tell the real story of what happened. With Signature, at least Barney Frank was willing to talk. But because of the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings, Silvergate execs couldn’t talk. Hetrick's affidavit is fascinating. She first talks about the infamous Fed/FDIC/OCC "joint statement" in January 2023 that was a first sign something was wrong: “At the time of the First Joint Statement, Silvergate Bank’s remaining deposit base was highly concentrated with crypto-asset related depositors, as it had been for several years.” Hetrick points out that Silvergate was able to weather the drawdown associated with rate rises and crypto industry balance sheet contraction – the company was still solvent when the dust had cleared. “The crisis of confidence across the digital asset industry, along with similar problems faced by banks across the country, caused a ‘run on the bank.’” Silvergate Bank was able to manage this bank run and pay all its depositors as they withdrew funds as a result of its liquidity risk management and planning. In an article included in the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s Economic Synopses detailing the speed and size of the most severe bank runs in 1984, 2008 and 2023, Silvergate Bank was the only bank included in the list of most severe bank runs that did not fail, experience a forced sale or government takeover or require government funds for stabilization. This is the smoking gun: Silverage was solvent and able to operate, but the Fed had informed executives that they had to curtail their crypto business. Without a crypto business, they would have had to reshape the entire firm. It was this that caused them to liquidate: “The increased supervisory pressure on Silvergate Bank and other banks focused on servicing crypto-asset businesses forced Silvergate Bank to a point where it would have needed to remake its business model away from its focus on crypto-asset businesses, seek to sell itself as a going concern in the shadow of the regulatory overhang or begin winding down its affairs[.]” Hetrick also discusses the Signature receivership and points out further evidence of Choke Point (as I wrote at the time) coming from the fact that crypto-related bank lines of business were NOT included in the acquisitions. “The closure and sale of the failed Signature Bank is illustrative of the intense regulatory pressure faced by banks in the digital assets industry at that time,” she notes. “On March 20, 2023, the FDIC announced Signature Bank was sold to Flagstar Bank, N.A., and that the sale did not include the transfer of cash depositors related to Signature Bank’s digital asset banking business.” Hetrick is very stark, writing: "This public signaling and sudden regulatory shift made clear that, at least as of the first quarter of 2023, the Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies would not tolerate banks with significant concentrations of digital asset customers, ultimately preventing Silvergate Bank from continuing its digital asset focused business model." So the Biden bank regulators made it impossible for banks serving a particular legal industry to operate. And in doing so, they actively caused the collapse of certain banks, namely Silvergate and Signature. These banks did not die by suicide but by murder. This remains a gigantic scandal, and no one has ever faced any responsibility for it. Neither the press nor the public really knows the truth. And the Biden administration keeps denying its role in OCP 2.0 even though the evidence is abundantly clear. Hetrick's testimony is so important because it's direct, on-the-record, under-penalty-of-perjury evidence of what we have known all along but that no one has been willing to admit: The Biden administration directly forced Silvergate out of business. The bank did NOT die on its own due to mismanagement or bad trades. It was killed because the Fed said it wasn't allowed to serve crypto clients, as a bank. When executives liquidated, the crypto lines of business like SEN were tossed in the garbage rather than allowed to continue to exist. And by the way, what the Biden administration is doing is blatantly illegal. Cooper and Kirk, the law firm that sued over OCP 1.0 under Obama, has pointed out that OCP 2.0 violates the Fifth Amendment. I'm still so fired up about this over a year later because the popular narrative around Silvergate and Signature is "oh they just made stupid balance sheet mistakes," when the truth is they were taken out back and shot by their own regulators. The fragility of the crypto banks was worsened by folks like Sen. Warren publicly calling for a bank run and making false allegations that these banks had criminal exposure to FTX. Which proved to be a huge lie. The fact that a sitting senator encouraged a bank run is completely insane, by the way! And then the regulators took the outflows from these banks as evidence that crypto was indeed too risky for banks to deal with and used that as an excuse to clamp down and install new rules making it impossible to be a crypto bank – Dunkin’ banned from selling donuts. The whole thing is such a maddening scandal that it makes my blood boil, which is why it's so important that we get to the truth and testimony like Elaine's is so important. If we let the Biden administration pretend government did nothing wrong and these banks just happened to die on their own, regulators will do it again. As I write, they are still actively suppressing the crypto industry via the deprivation of banking. If you are an entrepreneur or have any exposure to crypto, you should be upset about this too. They are targeting your livelihood and making it impossible for you to operate normally, by making banking inaccessible/expensive. I feel extremely vindicated. Since it was published in 2023, my original reporting has been 100% correct (with small details wrong, like the Fed, not the FDIC, imposing the 15% cap). But I'm not happy. I’m upset because even though people talk about OCP 2.0, no one really understands how bad a scandal it was. The government destroyed several banks because the government didn't like that they served a totally legal industry. That's the plain truth of it. It's 10 times worse than people think.

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA - SEPTEMBER 25: US Vice President and Democratic nominee for President ... [+] Kamala Harris speaks at an event hosted by The Economic Club of Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon University on September 25, 2024 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the speech, Harris gave details about her economic platform, including ways to support small businesses and making home ownership more attainable, among other policy proposals. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) Getty Images In a speech at The Economic Club of Pittsburgh on Sept. 25, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris outlined her vision for an “Opportunity Economy” — a strategy focused on strengthening the middle class, fostering innovation, and ensuring America’s leadership in key industries like clean energy and emerging technologies. Harris emphasized creating jobs, lowering costs for middle-class families, and investing in innovation as central pillars of her plan. As a legal, policy and economic justice expert in digital assets and blockchain, I see a tremendous opportunity for this technology to drive real, meaningful change. Blockchain’s ability to foster transparency, decentralization, and trust without intermediaries can redefine industries, expand access to financial services, and create a more equitable economy. Below, I highlight five key areas where blockchain can accelerate Harris’s Opportunity Economy, positioning America as a leader in the digital future. These opportunities are not just theoretical; they represent real pathways to innovation and inclusive growth. 1. Empowering Middle-Class Financial Inclusion Through DeFi One of Harris’s primary goals is to lower costs for middle-class families, particularly in housing, childcare, and eldercare. Blockchain’s decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions can be a powerful tool in this effort. DeFi platforms allow users to access lending, borrowing, and saving services without relying on traditional banks, which often charge high fees and impose barriers to entry. For example, blockchain-based mortgage platforms could streamline the home-buying process, reducing costs and time. Additionally, tokenized real estate allows families to invest in fractional homeownership, helping them get a foot in the door without needing a large down payment. Harris’s vision of wealth-building for middle-class families aligns perfectly with the democratizing potential of DeFi, offering accessible financial products that reduce reliance on intermediaries and promote financial inclusion. 2. Revitalizing Small Businesses with Blockchain-Based Capital Access Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and Harris’s plan to increase access to capital is critical for their growth. However, many entrepreneurs struggle to secure funding from traditional financial institutions. Blockchain can provide new avenues for raising capital, such as tokenization, smart contracts, and decentralized crowdfunding.

Smart contracts further streamline loan agreements, reducing administrative costs and delays by executing automatically when predefined conditions are met. By integrating blockchain into small business funding models, Harris’s administration could fuel innovation and growth in communities across the nation, helping to reach the ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of her first term. 3. Leading the World in Clean Energy Innovation Harris pledged to make the U.S. a global leader in clean energy, and blockchain technology can significantly support this mission. Contrary to popular belief, blockchain technology can facilitate transparent and efficient energy markets by enabling decentralized grids, tracking carbon credits, and supporting peer-to-peer energy trading. These innovations align with Harris’s goals of investing in clean energy technologies like advanced batteries and sustainable energy infrastructure. Blockchain can also improve transparency in energy production and consumption by providing immutable records of energy transactions. This ensures accountability and compliance with environmental regulations, while enhancing trust among stakeholders. Additionally, its decentralized nature can reduce reliance on traditional intermediaries, streamlining processes and increasing efficiency, which further strengthens U.S. competitiveness in the global clean energy market. 4. Democratizing Workforce Development with Blockchain Certifications In her speech, Harris highlighted the importance of skills-based hiring over traditional degree requirements and committed to doubling the number of registered apprenticeships. Blockchain can help accelerate this shift by providing a secure, verifiable method for issuing digital credentials and certifications. Blockchain-based credentials offer a tamper-proof way for workers to demonstrate their skills, allowing them to build a digital resume recognized across industries. This supports Harris’s commitment to workforce development by creating more accessible pathways to high-paying jobs in fields like AI, blockchain, and clean energy. Additionally, as Harris moves to eliminate degree requirements for federal jobs, blockchain could ensure merit-based hiring and provide transparency in the hiring process. 5. Boosting Affordable Housing Through Tokenization Affordable housing is a key pillar of Harris’s Opportunity Economy, and blockchain can help achieve this goal by making real estate more accessible. Tokenizing real estate assets allows for fractional ownership, lowering the barrier to entry for first-time homebuyers. Blockchain can also streamline housing transactions by eliminating intermediaries, reducing costs, and speeding up processes. For renters, blockchain-based smart contracts can automate rent payments and enforce lease agreements, making the rental process more efficient and secure. By integrating blockchain into housing initiatives, Harris’s administration could drive down costs, make homeownership more accessible, and help families build intergenerational wealth. Clearing The Hurdles To Crypto Adoption Myth Busting text on document above brown isolated on Office Desk getty Despite the clear opportunities blockchain presents, many people remain hesitant to engage due to persistent myths that fuel what I call the fear of getting in (FOGI). Common misconceptions—like the belief that crypto is too complicated, only used by criminals, or isn’t regulated—deter potential investors and innovators. The reality is that cryptocurrencies have become far more user-friendly, with platforms designed for ease of use. Additionally, blockchain’s transparency makes it harder for illicit activity to go unnoticed, and regulatory frameworks, such as crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), are creating safer avenues for investment. Concerns about the environmental impact are also being addressed as newer cryptocurrencies adopt energy-efficient models and bitcoin mining increasingly incorporates renewable energy. By debunking these myths, more individuals and businesses can confidently explore the opportunities that blockchain and digital assets offer—especially in sectors where Harris’s Opportunity Economy is focused on fostering growth and innovation. Blockchain’s Role In Building The Opportunity Economy Harris’s vision of an Opportunity Economy is built on fairness, opportunity, and innovation. Blockchain and digital assets are uniquely positioned to support this vision by democratizing access to financial services, revitalizing small businesses, advancing clean energy, fostering workforce development, and expanding affordable housing. As Harris continues to outline her economic agenda, it’s essential to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain in shaping the future of American industry and economic growth. By embracing blockchain and digital assets, we can ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in innovation while empowering the middle class and fostering economic opportunity for all.

                            Digital assets and US stocks are moving more in tandem than at almost any time in the past, based on a correlation study, signaling that the macroeconomic variables driving equities are also shaping the crypto market. A 40-day correlation coefficient for a gauge of the largest 100 digital assets and the S&P 500 Index is at about 0.67, a level exceeded only in the second quarter of 2022 when it topped 0.72, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A reading of 1 indicates assets are moving in lockstep, while minus 1 signals an inverse tie. US stocks hit all-time peaks and Bitcoin jumped past $64 000 last week after the Federal Reserve kicked off an anticipated cycle of monetary easing with an aggressive 50 basis-point reduction in interest rates. Incoming US economic data are pivotal now for traders of all stripes for clues about the possible extent and pace of further cuts in benchmark borrowing costs. “Macro factors are driving crypto prices currently, and this should continue throughout the Fed’s easing cycle, unless we see a crypto-specific black swan event,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for trading in digital-asset derivatives. Fed comments, PCE Front and center this week will be commentary from Fed officials as well as the release of the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index. “We view the speakers as being more important than the PCE inflation data as it’s really the FOMC reaction function that is key at the moment that the market is trying to ascertain,” said Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, rose less than 1% to $63 480 as of 7:38 a.m. Monday in New York amid modest gains across most major digital tokens. The advance came alongside a climb in US equity futures.

                            Diving into the cryptocurrency world can initially feel overwhelming, but it's pretty exciting once you get the hang of it! Whether you've heard about Bitcoin's insane growth over the years or the buzz around other coins like Ethereum and Dogecoin, it's clear that crypto is here to stay. If you're ready to take your first steps into this space, you're in the right place. Despite the rise of thousands of other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, often called "digital gold."But before you jump in, there's one critical piece of advice: always secure your assets. Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, and having a secure one is non-negotiable. That's where the Exodus Wallet comes in—an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly platform that will keep your coins safe and make your crypto journey a breeze.In this guide, we'll walk you through how to invest in crypto including how to buy Bitcoin and how to use Exodus Wallet. From setting up your account to buying your first Bitcoin (or other cryptos), you'll learn the basics and feel confident as you make your first moves in this new frontier.Creating Your Crypto WalletAfter downloading and installing the Exodus Wallet, you'll first want to tap 'Create New Wallet.' After creating a new wallet, you can tap 'Take the Tour' for a quick walkthrough of the wallet's features. This tour is super helpful for getting familiar with the layout and tools.Now comes the critical part: your secret recovery phrase and setting a password. After your first crypto deposit, Exodus will prompt you to back up your wallet. You can also view the secret phrase and set a password in Profile > Security if you're on mobile or the browser extension. Or Settings > Backup if you're on the desktop app. You'll need to carefully write down each word of your secret 12-word recovery phrase. The secret recovery phrase is the key to your funds. If anyone else gets ahold of it, they can steal your crypto. So, keep it somewhere safe and never share it—not even with Exodus Support!Buying Bitcoin Via ExodusHow to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the Exodus Wallet is a smooth and straightforward process, whether using the mobile app, desktop, or browser extension wallet. One of the standout features of Exodus is the variety of payment methods available to users, empowering you to choose the most convenient option. You can purchase crypto using a credit card, making it incredibly convenient, especially for those just starting. In addition to credit cards, Exodus also supports debit cards,bank accounts, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Buying crypto is facilitated by third-party services like MoonPay or Ramp, which partner with Exodus, depending on the location.On Exodus Mobile, buying cryptocurrency is easy. Just tap the Buy & Sell icon, choose your payment currency, and enter the amount. Next, select the cryptocurrency you want to buy, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The app will show you the provider offering the best rate, but you can switch providers if you'd like. You may also need to pick a third-party fiat provider to process the payment.Once you tap Buy, your crypto will arrive in your wallet within 5 to 20 minutes, depending on network traffic. For first-time purchases, you'll need to verify your details with the provider. Even for repeat purchases, you'll be redirected to the provider's widget in your browser to review and confirm your order before completing the transaction and returning to Exodus.The process on Exodus Desktop is quite similar. Click the 'Buy & Sell' icon, select the fiat currency you're paying with, and choose the crypto you want to buy. You can enter an amount or pick from preset options like $100, $500, or Max. After selecting your payment method—again, with the option to use a credit card—you can continue with the purchase, and your crypto will typically show up in your wallet within minutes.Using the Exodus Web3 Wallet is just as easy. After clicking the 'Buy & Sell' icon, you select the fiat currency you'll be using, enter the amount, and pick the crypto you want to buy. You can then choose a payment method like a credit card and finalise the purchase. Like the other platforms, your crypto will usually arrive in 5 to 20 minutes, depending on network conditions.Why Should I Choose Exodus Over Other Wallets?The wallet you choose can make a huge difference in your overall experience when managing your cryptocurrency.

                    Proposal for Minnesota crypto mining operation pulled after public opposition

                            Greater Minnesota Proposal for Minnesota crypto mining operation pulled after public opposition Windom residents feared noise pollution from data facility proposed by Revolve Labs. By Jp Lawrence The Minnesota Star Tribune September 25, 2024 at 8:16PM Revolve Labs representative Jeff St. Onge, center left, answers questions in August from skeptical citizens of Windom, Minn., about a proposed crypto mining facility near the city. The company pulled its application for the facility on Sept. 24, 2024, Cottonwood County said. A crypto mining company has ended its efforts to build a facility at a site in rural southwest Minnesota. The company, Colorado-based Revolve Labs, withdrew its conditional use application for a crypto mining facility outside Windom, Minn., via an email sent Tuesday to the city and reviewed by the Star Tribune. The decision came in response to feedback received by the company, Jeff St. Onge, senior operations manager at Revolve Labs, said Wednesday in an email. “Our commitment is to operate in a way that aligns with community values and priorities, and we recognize that collaboration is essential to achieving this,” St. Onge said. Revolve Labs, formerly known as Bit 49, had said the project would generate $35,000 a month in service fees for Windom, located about 65 miles south of Mankato. The proposal faced widespread opposition at a late August public hearing of about 100 residents, many of whom voiced skepticism about the company’s claims. The most common concern was noise. Crypto mining uses huge amounts of computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles and produce cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, a digital currency that can be traded outside the normal banking system. The machines used for these operations operate around the clock and need to be cooled by banks of fans. Windom residents brought up Revolve’s crypto mining operation in Glencoe, Minn., that has faced complaints by residents of excessive noise. Others spoke of the effect on home values, with some speakers questioning whether crypto mining benefits society. The meeting ended with a recommendation for a moratorium on conditional-use permits for crypto mining in the county. Representatives for Revolve Labs had been adamant that they had ways of preventing noise pollution at the proposed Windom location, located near Cottonwood Lake. On Wednesday, reaction to the news was mixed. “They are overjoyed the current worry is over,” said Hilary Mathis, who owns a shop in Windom and is running for city mayor. Related Coverage Local Neighbors unhappy about crypto mining operation in Glencoe, Minn. Jason Sykora, superintendent for the city’s electrical utility, said he was disappointed that more people didn’t give the proposal a fair shot. Sykora said the money generated by the project would have provided badly needed funding for the city. “It would have flattened out our electricity rates for the next three years possibly,” he said.

                    PayPal to allow cryptocurrency buying, holding and selling for US merchants

                            PayPal Holdings announced on Wednesday it is enabling U.S. merchants to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency from their business accounts. Cryptocurrency has moved from being a nascent asset class towards greater market acceptance after bitcoin exchange traded funds were approved for listing by the U.S. SEC earlier in the year. "Business owners have increasingly expressed a desire for the same cryptocurrency capabilities available to consumers," said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, Senior Vice President of Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Currencies at PayPal. PayPal joined the cryptocurrency market in 2020, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other virtual coins using the digital payments company's online wallets. The company became the first major financial technology firm to embrace digital currencies for payments and transfers when it launched its dollar-backed stablecoin in August 2023. Stablecoins are crypto tokens whose monetary value is pegged to a stable asset to protect potential investors from wild swings in prices. San Jose, California-based PayPal is also enabling U.S. merchants to transfer cryptocurrency on chain externally to third party eligible wallets. However, the services would not be available for business accounts in New York State at launch, the company said on its website. Shares of the company have gained nearly 26 per cent so far this year.

                    Trump’s own followers literally laughed at his crypto debt idea

                            Despite flip-flopping on cryptocurrencies in a desperate effort to woo voters and perhaps line his own pockets, Donald Trump still doesn’t seem to have any idea how these currencies actually work. At an event for crypto enthusiasts over the weekend, the former president proposed paying down the U.S. debt with cryptocurrencies and a few supplies from Staples. “Maybe we’ll pay off the $35 trillion in crypto,” he said. “How do you like that? I’ll write on a little piece of paper, ‘$35 trillion crypto’ — we have no debt. Right? That’s what I like.” The room broke out in laughter as Trump pointed at someone and said: “He likes that idea, too; he’s laughing.” But the GOP presidential nominee wasn’t kidding about his magical solution for the national debt, which Republicans only seem to care about during Democratic presidencies. In fact, Trump made the same suggestion in a Fox News interview last month, saying that “a little crypto check” could “wipe out” the $35 trillion. If it were that easy, one wonders why he didn’t do it during his first term. Now, the suggestion — as dumb as it sounds — seems like a way to reward the crypto bros who’ve backed Trump’s campaign. To better understand how disastrous this idea could ultimately be in practice, I recommend reading this Forbes article by analyst Ben Ritz, and this Medium article by crypto entrepreneur Tavonia Evans. In the meantime, it appears we can add cryptocurrency to wind power, basic economics, climate change and reproductive health to the long list of topics about which Trump is utterly clueless.

                    Cryptocurrency platform boss urges tighter regulation
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            PARIS — The co-founder of one of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies called for tighter regulation of the sector to guard against the fraud and wild swings that have dogged it, in an interview with AFP. Jeremy Allaire of Circle recounted the US firm's decision to offer a stabilised cryptocurrency — and insisted crypto operators owed it to society to submit to safeguards just as other emerging sectors such as AI must. "We have social objectives that we have to match against the technology," Allaire said during a visit this week to Circle's European headquarters in Paris. Circle offers a USDC "stablecoin", pegged to the dollar, as well as a euro-pegged variant, EURC. Currently, $35.5 billion worth of USDC are in circulation. As with other cryptocurrencies, transactions are recorded on a decentralised ledger, the blockchain, and not by a bank as is the case with traditional currencies. However, whereas the dollar value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin tends to fluctuate, often wildly, the creators of stablecoins actively target a stable value. In a world propelled by technological development, Allaire said, safeguards are vital for such activities. "If I'm writing software to control a ballistic missile system, that should be regulated activity," said Allaire. "If I'm writing a large language model and deploying that, and it has the potential to do very problematic things in society, there need to be rules that need to be assessed. Crypto is the same thing." Crypto fraud, ransomware Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform. The best-known cyptocurrency, bitcoin, remains the currency of choice for paying on the dark web without leaving any trace. It is used for extorting funds via ransomware attacks, which block access to victims' computer systems and demand a ransom payment. According to a recent report by Chainanalysis, the first half of 2024 was marked by a decrease in illicit activities. However, over that period, $460 million was paid out for ransomware, a rise of 2 per cent on a year earlier. Crypto exhanges operate through open-source software, Allaire noted. "That helps with transparency, visibility, security, other things." But some have been "using the technology to do things outside of any kind of supervision", he conceded. "You've seen fraud, abuse. You've seen people running off with money." When cryptocurrency emerged, "unregulated intermediaries" sprang up in the sector, he said. "Of course, the risks they take... in many cases, have led to significant losses," Allaire said. "But that's not an argument against the technology. That's an argument against humans. And it's an argument for better supervision." EU, US crypto regulations Regulators across the globe have taken note. Last year the European Parliament adopted an EU-wide framework for crypto asset markets, "MiCA" — Markets in Crypto-Assets — requiring mandatory approval for digital-asset service providers. In July, Circle announced it was the first "stablecoin" issuer to comply with this new regulation. Stablecoins are used to facilitate intra-crypto exchanges by investors without having to go through a bank. But they also give users access to a product pegged to the dollar without having a bank account in the United States, and allow cross-border payments or money transfers. In the United States too, greater regulation is on the agenda. US presidential candidate Kamala Harris was quoted as telling Bloomberg last week: "We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors." In May the US House of Representatives passed a legal framework designed to regulate the crypto market — the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. Circle is meanwhile preparing to move its headquarters from Boston to New York City — "at the very top of the World Trade Centre... the very heart of the dollar international system", says Allaire. "That's in part symbolic. It's also who we are, what we're doing. We're building, hopefully, the world's leading digital dollar and upgrading to this new internet financial system."

                    Meme coiners are trying to get rich quick off Moo Deng
                </h3>

                            A crypto meme token created on the back of viral pygmy hippo Moo Deng has a market cap of over $90 million just two weeks after being launched. That means that the total amount of tokens in circulation, at their current value, are worth around $91.8 million. For the uninitiated, Moo Deng is a particularly cute pygmy hippo newborn who lives at a zoo in Thailand. Moo Deng is the Thai name of a dish called “bouncing pork,” and fans of the eternally wet hippo are particularly taken with TikToks of its chaotic attitude and constant, high-spirited screaming. The hippo went so viral that Khao Kheow Open Zoo, in the center of the country, set up a livestream of its enclosure. Cryptocurrency pumpers have also gotten in on the act, launching a token through Solana’s Pump.fun platform, which people use to quickly generate meme coins. Over 12,685 people are currently holding the meme coin, which is tradin at around 9 cents per coin on as of Wednesday afternoon. It is up 30% over the past 24 hour and is four times as valuable as it was last week. As Decrypt points out, the coin’s Twitter account also functions as a popular fan page for people who can’t get enough of Moo Deng, posting memes and cute moments, engagement bait that can help raise the profile of both the hippo and the coin. As of Wednesday afternoon, the X account has almost 42,000 followers. The largest holder of the coin is an account called “skbdito10b.sol,” who’s owns 18 million tokens, or 1.83% of all holdings, currently worth over $1.6 million. Another account with holdings worth over 1% of the entire stake is moodeng.sol, the same name as the fan page. The @MoodengSOL account didn’t immediately confirm whether they own the wallet. It holds over 11 million tokens worth just over $1 million as of Wednesday afternoon. According to the MoodengSOL web page, investors in the coin will be tossing some money over to the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in the form of fees. MoodengSOL didn’t immediately respond to questions about how much those fees are worth or if it’s transferred any over to the zoo yet. Khao Kheow Open Zoo also didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether they’ve been in touch with the Moo Deng team about the donations. But one thing is for certain, any memeable internet moment has the possibility to be turned into a coin. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

                            Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are emerging as key players in the global cryptocurrency market, fuelling a sector now valued at $338.7 billion. Both Gulf nations have embraced blockchain technology and digital assets as part of their broader economic diversification efforts, positioning themselves as regional hubs for crypto innovation. The UAE, particularly Dubai, has been at the forefront of developing a regulatory framework to attract crypto exchanges and fintech startups. In recent years, Dubai’s crypto-friendly policies have drawn major players such as Binance and Kraken, solidifying its reputation as a digital finance hub. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is exploring blockchain use cases for sectors like banking and logistics, as part of its Vision 2030 plan to modernise its economy and reduce reliance on oil. With strategic investments in blockchain technology and a growing interest in decentralised finance (DeFi), both nations are driving significant growth in the Middle East’s cryptocurrency market. Experts predict that the region’s regulatory clarity and investment in digital infrastructure will continue to propel the crypto market forward, making Saudi Arabia and the UAE key destinations for crypto innovation and investment.

                    US pledges to support Nigeria’s call for UN Security Council reform
                </h3>

                            On the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly’s 79th session (UNGA 79), US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield met with Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar to discuss the growing US-Nigeria partnership. The meeting touched on a wide range of issues, including security, trade, investment, and health. In particular, Ms Thomas-Greenfield reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to reforming the UN Security Council to make it more inclusive and representative, with specific support for adding two permanent seats for African countries. Nigeria has repeatedly demanded a reform of the UN Security Council and the allocation of permanent seats for African countries. PREMIUM TIMES reported that Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu, represented by his deputy, Kashim Shettima, reiterated this while addressing world leaders Wednesday during the General Debate of the ongoing UNGA. At their meeting on Wednesday, the US ambassador emphasised the importance of deepening US-Nigeria cooperation on critical issues. According to a statement by US Mission spokesperson Lauren French, “Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield spoke about continued cooperation between the United States and Nigeria as well as opportunities to deepen the US-Nigeria partnership on security, trade and investment, health and other global issues.” This statement reflects the US’s ongoing efforts to forge stronger alliances with African nations and advance key global initiatives that affect the continent. The inclusion of permanent African representation on the UN Security Council is a longstanding demand from African leaders, and the US has positioned itself as a major proponent of such reforms, recognising the need to modernise international institutions to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. At the meeting, Ms Thomas-Greenfield reiterated the US position on UN Security Council reform, calling for a more representative global body. The statement from the US Mission read, “Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to reforming the Security Council to make it more inclusive, representative, and effective, including by adding two permanent seats for African countries.” This push for reform appears to show US commitment to addressing the historical imbalance in global governance structures, ensuring that Africa, a continent of 54 nations, has a more significant role in decision-making on issues affecting global peace and security. While no specific countries were mentioned as potential candidates, Nigeria is often seen as a leading contender for a permanent seat due to its economic influence, regional leadership, and active participation in peacekeeping missions across Africa. The conversation between Ms Thomas-Greenfield and Mr Tuggar also underscored the importance of US-Nigeria security cooperation. Nigeria continues to face serious internal security challenges, primarily from extremist groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), which have destabilised large parts of the country and caused immense suffering. A report by this reporter, published in Modern Diplomacy on May 10, 2024, titled Nigeria: Understanding the Surge of Terrorism and Its Impact on Civilians (2018-2022), delves into the devastating toll of terrorism in Nigeria. The analysis documents how insurgent attacks have displaced millions of civilians, hampered economic growth, and created a lasting humanitarian crisis in the country. Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains a critical partner in regional security efforts and plays a vital role in the broader fight against terrorism in West Africa. During the meeting, Ms Thomas-Greenfield also raised the case of US citizen Tigran Gambaryan, who is currently detained in Nigeria. The ambassador stressed the importance of his immediate release, signalling that this matter is a top priority for US diplomatic efforts. Mr Gambaryan, an official of crypto firm Binance, is being detained and tried in Nigeria for money laundering. The Nigerian government accuses Binance of being used to launder money, an allegation the firm denies. Although the US statement did not include the details of Mr Gambaryan’s detention, this issue underscores the complexities of international relations and the role that diplomacy plays in protecting US citizens abroad. As discussions at UNGA 79 continue, the US-Nigeria relationship remains a key focus, with both nations looking to enhance their cooperation on critical issues such as security, trade, health, and UN reforms. The ongoing dialogue reflects the mutual interests shared by both countries in addressing global challenges, from terrorism to economic development. Nigeria, with its strategic importance and regional influence, is positioned to play a crucial role in any future reforms of the UN Security Council. The US has now signalled its support for Africa’s inclusion in permanent decision-making forums, aligning with broader efforts to modernise global governance institutions. As these discussions progress, the future of US-Nigeria relations will likely continue to evolve in response to shared global challenges. Whatever the outcomes of UNGA 79 will be, this year’s events will be closely watched as countries grapple with the need for a more inclusive and effective UN, with Africa’s role at the centre of these pivotal reforms.

                    How Should Crypto Firms Be Preparing For The EU’s New Licensing Rules?
                </h3>

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The EU is seeing a proliferation of interest in digital assets LightRocket via Getty Images At the end of this year, the second and final part of the EU’s game-changing new MiCA (Markets in Crypto-assets) regulation will come into force, requiring crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to obtain a license from their domestic regulator. Once licensed, CASPs will have access to the entire EU market, representing around 450 million people, and a huge growth opportunity for the digital asset sector. How should CASPs, including exchanges, brokers, and custodians, be preparing? With 27 member states undergoing the transition, there’s a world of legal detail to get lost in here. But the headline requirements aren’t so complicated. Under Article 60 of the MiCA rules, certain financial institutions that are already regulated under existing EU financial frameworks, such as credit institutions, securities depositories, investment firms, and others, will effectively inherit their status with regard to crypto-asset activities. As such, the only requirement is for them to notify their regulator of the intention to provide digital asset services 40 days in advance of the provision. Regulators in some countries, including the Netherlands and Italy, have issued a procedure for notification or indicated an intention to do so. Others have yet to do so, but even so, the notification requirement is relatively basic for qualifying institutions. Obtaining an EU-wide MiCA License For CASPs that don’t qualify for the Article 60 notification requirement, obtaining a license is the only route to legal operation in the EU after the end of this year. For this, they’ll need to look to the domestic regulator, and the procedure will largely depend on their current license to operate in their home member state. Any new CASP that wants to kick off their service provision from January 1, 2025, will need to apply for a license from scratch. The state of licensing procedures per country largely correlates to the amount of CASP activity already in the country. For example, Germany, France, and Ireland have all issued detailed information, including procedures and timelines. Typically, new CASPs can already begin to engage with domestic regulators by submitting an intention via the regulator’s website.

In some countries, the procedure may be less clear. Some are still clearing the necessary lawmaking procedures to ensure that MiCA can be implemented without conflict with any existing legislation. Intriguingly, Belgium simply has no existing licensed digital asset activities or operators that the regulators need to address. However, in most cases, regulators have indicated a willingness to engage with would-be CASPs, even in the absence of a formal published process, so it’s worth initiating contact. The other category comprises the many hundreds of CASPs that already have a home in a European member state, and the good news is that they benefit from transitional arrangements. This effectively means that any existing regime – or crucially, even the absence of one – can be grandfathered for a period until the regulator can grant MiCA CASP licenses. An Early Mover Advantage What does this mean in practice? A CASP in a country such as the Netherlands, which has never regulated digital assets, can continue providing services to Dutch users within the transitional period until its EU CASP license is granted. CASPs in countries such as France, which operates an existing licensing regime, can also continue providing services to French users throughout the transitional period until their EU CASP license is granted. However, there are two important points to note here. Firstly, the transitional arrangements only apply to the member state where the CASP operates, meaning a Dutch CASP can only service Dutch users, and a French CASP can only service French users throughout the transitional period. CASPs must have obtained their MiCA license to provide services to users in other EU member states outside their own. A second consideration is the duration of the transition period. MiCA allows for a maximum transition of 18 months up to June 30, 2026. However, member states can shorten the transition, and plenty, including Spain, Italy, and Germany, have already indicated an intention to do so. Therefore, there is plenty of incentive for CASPs to kick off their licensing application as early as possible, to obtain the portability of the MiCA license before the transition period ends. While the transition to a regulated digital asset market necessarily comes with a degree of administrative complexity and overhead, the EU is seeing a proliferation of interest in digital assets that will undoubtedly pay long-term dividends for any short-term pain. Furthermore, the shift to a regulated status means that the future of the industry on EU soil is now a legal certainty, paving the way for further adoption and reinforcing the value of the early mover advantage.

                            The promise of blockchain to change the world hasn’t materialized. For the most part, the technology has instead enabled people to speculate on a new asset class. A big hurdle to realizing blockchain’s full potential, web3 proponents argue, is that decentralized services are incredibly hard to build. Tomasz Tunguz, best known for his popular startup blog and successful SaaS bets at Redpoint Ventures, believes he’s identified a company that will greatly lower the barriers to building blockchain apps. That company is Initia, which recently closed a $14 million Series A round with around 90% of the capital coming from Tunguz’s Theory Ventures, TechCrunch exclusively learned. The funding, which gives Initia a $350 million token valuation, marks Theory’s first investment in both equity and tokens. Theory is allocating its $230 million fund across roughly 12 startups, focusing on three themes: data, AI, and blockchain. “Ethereum is worth seven Snowflakes put together,” Tunguz told TechCrunch, comparing the second-largest blockchain network to the cloud storage company. (Around our interview in mid-September, Ethereum’s market cap was about $293 billion; Snowflake’s stood at $37 billion.) “These next-generation databases and programming platforms can produce huge outcomes,” he added. The fresh round brings the total raised by Initia to $22.5 million, including previous funding from Delphi Ventures, HackVC and Binance Labs. Fragmented garden The development environment for decentralized apps is highly fragmented. Rather than using a general-purpose Layer 1 network like Ethereum and Solana, developers increasingly turn to specialized chains, or app chains, that are designed with optimal performance in certain blockchain characteristics, such as transaction speed and security. Nonetheless, these bespoke chains generally lack interoperability with each other, and this is where Initia comes in. Billing itself as the “iOS for web3” — that’s quite a bold ambition — the startup runs a Layer 1 network that gives disparate app chains programming compatibility with each other while offering them the flexibility to tweak their execution environment as needed. “If you want to build an application inside of web3, it’s a five-layer cake. You probably want to start with a reasonable cake and as you grow, swap out different layers,” said Tunguz. Those layers include functions like consensus (where network validators agree on the state of a blockchain) and data availability (where the state of the blockchain gets posted to the blockchain). Developers may also want to change certain “underlying performance characteristics” of the decentralized databases without compromising security. “For financial applications, you want low latency. For different kinds of applications, you may want a lot of security… That’s the roll-ups as a service or L2s,” said Tunguz. “Initia combines both of those innovations plus instant compatibility with most of the blockchains, so if you are a developer, it’s a great place to start because you have great defaults,” the investor said. Having a unified development environment also makes moving money easier across decentralized networks, boosting liquidity and eventually bringing convenience to users. Initia’s co-founder Stan Liu explained how Initia is streamlining the user experience of crypto-based prediction markets, where people bet on the outcome of certain events. “Recently, with all the presidential debates, prediction markets have come to the forefront again,” Liu told TechCrunch. “The big problem is that in order to facilitate all these types of trades and have actual volume, you need a really big amount of underlying liquidity on the protocol itself.” Liu gave the example of Polymarket, a popular predictions market. To place a bet, a user needs to deposit USDC stablecoins onto the platform. To do so, they need to pay a transaction fee, or gas fee, in the form of ETH on the Polygon blockchain. That means the user needs to first acquire some ETH on an exchange or another source, upon which they will have to “bridge” the currency to Polygon. Finally, to actually execute the bets, the user needs a wallet that’s compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, not just any crypto wallet. Liu said Contro, an Initia-powered prediction market, on the other hand, allows people to place bets in any cryptocurrency using any wallet. The process is possible because Initia supports multiple blockchain execution environments; app chains written in any of those environments can interact with each other by settling on Initia. Token investment Theory’s bet on Intia shows that web3 startups continue to attract capital from mainstream VCs despite highly volatile coin prices and ongoing public skepticism about crypto’s utility beyond financial speculation. Theory’s investment in Initia grants it a token warrant, giving it the right to buy the startup’s token should it launch in the future. Spencer Farrar, a partner at Theory Ventures, explained the rationale for pursuing a token round. “One, how do you bootstrap open-source development and encourage a fruitful ecosystem? A token can play a part in that. I’m taking a company public and raising money, which historically has been a long and expensive process, and potentially, tokens offer access to global actors.” Farrar, who previously built a project on Solana, also saw Initia’s developer relations as a selling point. “A unique characteristic about [Initia’s founders] Zon and Stan is they have very deep technical expertise but they are also able to work collaboratively with developers,” said Farrar. Specifically, he noted some of the projects building on Initia were using Move, an open source programming language developed at Meta and continued to be used by blockchains like Aptos and Sui. With all the hype for app chains, the industry is still in its infancy. By the estimates of Ezaan Mangalji, the other Initia co-founder, there are only around fifty app chains with active development. So far, eight projects are testing on Initia, which is gearing up for a mainnet launch within the next two months. The testnet recorded over 125 million transactions and nearly three million unique wallets. Tunguz is hopeful that efforts like Initia will help scale the multi-chain ecosystem. “As we modularize the database and pull out different components, whether it’s the data availability layer, the execution layer, or come up with different kinds of light nodes versus full nodes in order to scale it out, there are lots of people working at different parts of the full database to make them perform better,” said the investor. “The other reason is just we’ve seen 600-700x improvement [in blockchains] in the last three years, so there’s existent proof of meaningful performance improvements with different design choices.”

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Ether bounced back this week. (Photo by S3studio/Getty Images) 2018 S3studio Ether has shown its strength recently, bouncing back after becoming severely undervalued compared to bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value rose above $2,700 this week, reaching its highest value since late August, Coinbase figures provided by TradingView reveal. The digital asset has rallied close to 20% since September 18, additional Coinbase data reveals. This upward movement started the same day the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it was cutting the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points, a move that provided tailwinds for global risk assets. “Basically all crypto has been rallying since the Fed rate cut, but ETH has rallied stronger than Bitcoin, for example, because it has underperformed Bitcoin since The Merge (September 2022) and is now approaching extreme undervalued levels against it,” Moreno said via Telegram. The chart below, which leverages CryptoQuant data, helps depict this situation. The black line shows the ratio of ether prices to those of bitcoin. The purple line, on the other hand, displays the Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) of ether relative to that of bitcoin.

Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, September 25 Ether and bitcoin's price and Market Value to Realised Value CryptoQuant Ether’s ‘Recent Underperformance’ Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also emphasized how ether’s price has failed to keep up with that of bitcoin. “ETH has been underperforming BTC for most of the summer,” he stated via email. “That started to change with the US Federal Reserve’s 50 bps reduction in interest rates as, for some reason, ETH has reacted more bullishly than BTC,” Enneking noted. “The only reason we can come up with is that ETH is simply compensating for its recent underperformance,” he specified. “We do not see this as a secular shift back to the BTC-ETH ratio before ETH switched to POS from POW,” Enneking clarified. Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, also weighed in, offering a similar take. “Ethereum is currently experiencing a price recovery, but this seems more like a correction than a rally, as it has been undervalued in recent weeks,” she said via email. “On September 20th, the ETH/BTC ratio dipped to 0.038, its lowest point since April 2021, signaling that Ethereum had been priced too cheaply,” Liu added. “Last week, Ethereum's price erased all of its year-to-date gains, as if the much-anticipated ETH ETF had never happened,” she stated, shedding further light on the matter. “Meanwhile, alternative Layer 1s like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) have posted strong performances this year,” the analyst noted. “This underscores the clear undervaluation of ETH, and the current price recovery appears to be aligning it with the broader market.” Bullish Outlook Going forward, ether could be headed for substantial gains, stated Liu. “Ethereum is showing signs of repeating its 2021 pattern, with a potential for significant upside and volatility ahead,” she said. “The Ethereum blockchain continues to dominate, with the most active developers, the largest number of active users, and has a market cap almost five times that of its competitor Solana. With strong fundamentals, it seems poised for another potential rally, Liu concluded. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                    Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) rally hard, yet analysts remain bullish on Rexas Finance (RXS) as the real winner
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            In the last few weeks, cryptocurrency has been in favour of XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) among many other coins. Both of these coins have witnessed a substantial amount of price appreciation lately. Positive news for XRP emerged on the regulatory front, whereas for Dogecoin, the community supporters and the likes of Elon Musk have not stopped talking and backing the token. However, while these price movements are occurring, several analysts are slowly turning their attention to Rexas Finance (RXS) – the upcoming cryptocurrency in the market, which will excel in the future because of its unique strategy on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Ripple (XRP): Fueled by Regulatory Clarity XRP, the token of the Ripple network, has been in many circumstantial difficulties for these past few years. Most reports daily would be the litigation they have with the SEC. Despite this uncertainty, since the price of XRP was at an all-time low, even hostile, it still was gaining value and more recently appeared to shoot up substantively thanks to what many saw as positive verdicts, all of which pointed towards regulatory certainty. This has instilled much-needed faith among consumers, thereby uplifting the price of XRP to around $0.50 and above. Even though the performance of XRP’s price rally is optimistic, analysts believe that the future evolution of this cryptocurrency may depend on the outcome of the legal battles it faces. With regulatory clarity, XRP will certainly increase in value in the long run; however, until the case is completed, a certain degree of risk is involved for the investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Surge Continues Dogecoin (DOGE), the famous meme coin, refuses to stop its internal rally, driven by the strong community and support from many, including the Twitter king Elon Musk. Priced around $0.06, the sell-off of Dogecoin, in particular its core supporter base and adoption in the economy rather than in the volume of transactions, nevertheless, surprised many investors. The advantages of making transactions in the Dogecoin network include low fees and an increasing number of businesses willing to accept it as a form of payment. Such companies like Tesla offer some of their products in exchange for DOGE and this increases the marketability of the currency further. On the other hand, Dogecoin is only as good as its community perception, as its value is not backed by any fundamental reason. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining Tokenization With XRP and Dogecoin thriving on their surges, it seems some analysts are forecasting the future of Rexas Finance rather positively. This emerging token is attracting attention with its distinct emphasis on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, offering users a chance to tokenize note assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This form of approach creates multi-trillion-dollar industries that were once out of reach to average investors. What Makes Rexas Finance Distinct from Others? RWA Tokenization: Instead of concentrating on speculative tokens, Rexas Finance has a proactive approach to the real world as it introduces RWA as a fractional ownership model of physical assets to the masses. This allows the normal population to invest in high-valuation assets such as real estate. High-Upside Growth: Currently, the Rexas Finance (RXS) presale is ongoing with each token going for $0.05. The sale has already gotten funding of over $1.25 million. Moreover, the analysts predict that these values will dramatically increase, possibly reaching up to & $20 towards the end of 2025, which represents a remarkable increase in value of up to 50,000%. Whale Interest: Already, Rexas Finance has started enticing whale investors. People who were holding tokens like XRP and Dogecoin, who were early adopters, are set to reap the longer-term growth of Rexas Finance’s vision. Comprehensive Ecosystem: To this end, Rexas Finance has enhanced the flexibility and security of the platform by offering tools such as the Rexas Token Builder and AI-based smart contract auditing using its AI Shield. Such characteristics are attractive not only to private persons but also to companies and institutions that wish to tokenize their assets. Conclusion: How Good is the Opportunity with Rexas Finance? As XRP and Dogecoin remain among the loved and favoured crypto assets, Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be the healthiest option for the right long-term investors. The combination of asset tokenization in the real world together with the spiking upside potential has indeed turned the heads of analysts and whale investors. In the coming years, Rexas Finance may probably be one of the greatest tokens of the crypto space as more people get used to the idea of tokenizing actual assets.
