                    OpenAI's X account was hacked to promote a crypto scam

                            OpenAI opened a newsroom Twitter account earlier this month and it's already been hacked. The new handle was taken over by a crypto scammer promoting a fake OpenAI token that was in reality a scam to steal Bitcoins. That follows similar hacks of three key OpenAI employee X accounts over the last 15 months, including the one belonging to CTO Mira Murati. The fraudster enticed potential victims by saying the OpenAI token is somehow "driven by artificial intelligence-based language models." It then threw in a jumble of crypto and AI buzzwords that were probably enough to lure in some gullible users. Going to "token-openai.com" would show them a fake but convincing OpenAI site. Anything they click asks to connect to their wallet, then presumably steals everything inside it. Several fraudulent posts were visible for around an hour before being removed and the account seems to be back to normal. OpenAI confirmed the problem and said they were looking into it, according to Bloomberg. Yesterday, the company's security team reportedly warned employees to secure their accounts due to a rise in recent account takeovers.

                    Crypto market pumps as Blackrock recommends investors to shift 85% to Bitcoin; DOGE left lagging behind
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The crypto market is humming following BlackRock, the biggest asset management worldwide, allegedly advising clients to allocate 85% of their portfolios to Bitcoin (BTC). With this audacious action, the value of Bitcoin has surged; other cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin (DOGE), lags behind. Meanwhile, Intel Markets (INTL) is attracting interest as investors swarm to BTC with its AI-driven trading tools, meant to let traders optimize possibilities across crypto assets, thereby placing itself as a major participant in this changing market environment. BlackRock’s bold Bitcoin (BTC) bet: Why 85% allocation signals a bullish breakout The fact that BlackRock has put Bitcoin’s (BTC) long-term potential at 85% on their recommendation shows how confident they are in it. The asset management argues that the large allocation is justified by the cryptocurrency’s stability, expanding utility as a store of value, and growing institutional interest. In addition, when the economy is in a state of flux, Bitcoin’s decentralized characteristics and dominant market position make it a tempting inflation and conventional market risk hedge. After breaking out from the $52,500 support level earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin has been rising consistently. The 200-day moving average is a significant barrier close to $64,000, although it has subsequently recovered the $57,000 and $60,000 levels. Bitcoin (BTC) may reach new record highs in the next weeks if positive sentiment persists and the price breaks out above this level. As the price of bitcoin has been consolidating recently, the 30-day moving average of the funds leaving the market indicates that miners have drastically cut down on selling. The decrease in supply in the market is likely caused by miners hoarding Bitcoin (BTC) in the hopes of its price going up. Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to break resistance as Whales accumulate amidst market recovery Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to lag behind despite the broader crypto market’s recovery, struggling to break out of its horizontal resistance at $0.11. Over the past month, the meme coin has faced selling pressure each time it attempted to rally, making three failed attempts to push above the resistance line. This ongoing challenge highlights Dogecoin’s inability to maintain momentum and capitalize on market improvements. A key factor behind Dogecoin’s stagnation is the balance between buying and selling pressures within its trading channel since August 4. While Dogecoin (DOGE) whales have significantly increased their accumulation, with large holders’ netflow surging by 179%, the price remains range-bound. The support at $0.09 holds firm, but the repeated failures to break through resistance suggest that sellers still dominate the market at critical levels. Currently, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) weighted sentiment sits at a negative -0.63, reflecting pessimism that has persisted since mid September. Intel Markets (INTL): Revolutionizing trading with 1000x leverage and AI powered Blockchain solutions Intel Markets (INTL) has recently dazzled the trading community by providing highly advanced trading tools to traders.

                    Sweden Classifies Some Crypto Exchanges as 'Professional Money Launderers'
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Sweden has classified some crypto exchanges and crypto-related service providers as 'professional money launderers' claiming that these platforms are often used by criminals to launder proceeds from all types of crimes via cryptocurrency. In the official notice, the authorities have identified four types of crypto exchanges that have been designated as professional money launderers (PMLs). The Swedish Police Authority and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of Sweden have collectively finalised this classification of crypto exchanges in the country. In a report compiled by Sweden's FIU, the authority states that the ability to launder large volumes of assets between crypto wallets internationally, without the oversight of an intermediary, has drawn criminals towards the crypto sector. “The assessment from FIU Sweden is that there is an increasing demand for PML from organised crime and that the services they provide are pivotal for the criminal economy,” the report said. “There are also individual crypto exchange providers that are more tightly connected to criminal networks, who do not typically advertise their services publicly.”What is the ‘REDI’ Framework for CBDC Adoption Suggested by IMF The Swedish authorities have divided illegal crypto exchanges (and those operating without a licence) into four profiles, outlining the different ways they are being exploited by criminals — node exchange providers, hawala exchange providers, asset exchange provider, and platform exchange provider. Under the first two categories, Sweden blames crypto exchanges for playing a crucial role in maintaining the criminal economy while also harbouring underground banking networks. In the other two categories, the authorities there claim illicit businesses related to cryptocurrencies are also giving criminals ways to launder their unlawful funds. “Crypto exchange providers in the form of PMLs can accommodate a diverse client base. The demand for crypto exchange services is very high among criminals, which suggests that the use of cryptocurrency is widespread within the criminal arena. By fueling the criminal infrastructure, the crypto exchange provider is part of a larger context. Their services support influential criminals in organised crime, thus helping to finance the spiral of violence and other serious crime,” the report noted.Qatar Financial Centre’s Digital Assets Lab Goes Live After Nearly a Year Sweden reportedly considers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin taxable financial instruments. At present, the crypto sector is largely unregulated in the country. The country is part of the European Union (EU) — and the bloc has already deployed a comprehensive set of regulations to govern the crypto sector called the MiCA framework. Sweden has suggested crypto trading platforms adhering to the MiCA laws to be very observant of any unrecognised patterns of trading on their client's wallets.

Better Specs – Solana promised better cameras, a higher-quality screen, and an upgraded battery, as well as a more portable design Seed Vault Wallet – the Wallet allows users to self-custody their digital assets and includes enhanced security features such as a burner mode and double-tap transactions Improved dApp Store Concept – the Seeker phone's independent app store, dApp Seeker 2.0, will enable developers to launch specialized cryptocurrency apps minus the high gas fees that usually come with mainstream app stores DePIN Integration – the Seeker is integrated with decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) functionality A Platform for AllSolana presented the upcoming smartphone as one that will sit well with Web3 users as they will have access to decentralized finance (DeFi), payments, gaming, and other segments in a single ecosystem, stepping up the game in the crypto smartphone sector.It is currently priced at $450 during the presale phase, and each Seeker generates a unique Seeker Genesis Token to unlock Solana ecosystem exclusive rewards, offers, and other content."We founded Solana Mobile with the mission of taking crypto mobile. To achieve that, we needed to make Seeker more accessible, more affordable, and for its hardware and software to be even more deeply integrated for Web3," said Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko.The Solana Seeker's unveiling comes amid lingering concerns about the price of Solana (SOL), the Solana blockchain's native cryptocurrency.Solana Price Refuses to Budge Despite ActivitySolana prices have been flat in recent months, even with activity and deposits in the network. There have been some days that SOL surged, such as the 16.4% spike between Sept. 18 and Sept. 20, but broadly, the token's price has largely been flat. Solana memecoins have also been in a slump, but the broader memecoin market may be preparing for a surge and remains a fast-growing sector.It remains to be seen how Solana Seeker will fare compared to the Saga. So far, the second-generation crypto phone has $70 million in pre-orders as per Blockonomi.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, rocketing by over 200%, largely due to the BlackRock-led Wall Street bitcoin revolution (which is suddenly hurtling toward a fresh earthquake). Now, as details emerge of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China has unleashed a flood of stimulus measures designed to prop up its stalling economy, hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and kicking off a global monetary policy easing cycle.

                    Kraken Expands Reach with Coin Meester Acquisition in Netherlands
                </h3>

                            Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has completed the acquisition of Coin Meester B.V. (BCM), marking a significant expansion into the Dutch market. This move is set to strengthen Kraken’s presence in Europe, as the company looks to consolidate its position in the competitive and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The acquisition allows Kraken to tap into the Dutch customer base of BCM, further broadening its reach across the European Union. With this acquisition, BCM’s clients will soon have access to over 200 digital assets, along with Kraken’s comprehensive product suite, which includes staking services, futures trading, and various other offerings that are part of its advanced platform. The integration is expected to take place over the coming months, during which time BCM users will transition to Kraken’s system, ensuring a smoother, more robust trading experience with broader asset availability. Kraken’s move into the Netherlands comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny and competition in the European cryptocurrency markets. The exchange has been actively positioning itself as a reliable platform in regions where regulations are tightening, aiming to provide users with a compliant, transparent, and secure service. Kraken’s European expansion strategy has gained momentum over the past few years, with this acquisition serving as a key milestone. Coin Meester, also known as BCM, has established itself as one of the leading digital asset platforms in the Netherlands. Founded in 2017, BCM primarily catered to Dutch users, offering access to a variety of cryptocurrencies and a user-friendly platform for buying and selling digital assets. It quickly gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts in the Netherlands due to its ease of use and localized customer support. By joining forces with Kraken, BCM aims to enhance its offering and better serve its growing customer base with a wider range of products and services. The acquisition is part of Kraken’s broader strategy to expand its presence in Europe, a region that has become increasingly important for cryptocurrency companies due to its regulatory framework and growing user base. Kraken’s CEO, David Ripley, emphasized the importance of the acquisition, stating that the deal aligns with Kraken’s mission to provide the most secure and comprehensive platform for users globally. He noted that the acquisition of BCM represents a significant step in expanding Kraken’s European footprint, enabling the company to serve a wider range of customers across the continent. For BCM customers, the transition to Kraken will bring several benefits. Kraken’s platform offers a more diverse selection of digital assets, sophisticated trading tools, and enhanced security features. Kraken is also known for its strong compliance with regulatory requirements, which is increasingly important in Europe as authorities introduce stricter rules for cryptocurrency exchanges. The acquisition is expected to provide BCM users with a more secure trading environment, along with the opportunity to participate in Kraken’s staking and futures trading options, among other offerings. Kraken has long been recognized as one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with a reputation for its strong security practices and commitment to regulatory compliance. The company operates in multiple jurisdictions globally, including the United States, Europe, and Asia, and has built a substantial user base due to its reliability, transparency, and extensive range of services. With this acquisition, Kraken will now be able to extend these same benefits to BCM’s users in the Netherlands, positioning itself as a dominant player in the Dutch market. This acquisition also highlights the growing trend of consolidation in the cryptocurrency industry. As the market matures and regulatory pressures increase, many smaller exchanges are finding it more challenging to navigate the complex legal landscape. Larger players like Kraken are seizing opportunities to acquire local platforms, allowing them to quickly scale their operations while adhering to local regulations. The BCM acquisition is seen as a move that will not only increase Kraken’s market share in Europe but also help streamline its compliance with the European Union’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Kraken’s decision to acquire BCM can also be viewed in the context of the rapidly evolving European regulatory environment. The European Union has introduced several regulations aimed at ensuring the safety and transparency of digital asset transactions, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. By acquiring BCM, Kraken ensures that it is better positioned to comply with these regulations while offering its full suite of services to a European audience. Kraken’s proactive approach to regulatory compliance has been a hallmark of its business strategy, setting it apart from competitors that have struggled with legal challenges in different jurisdictions. For Kraken, the Netherlands represents a key market with significant growth potential. Dutch consumers have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrencies over the years, with increasing participation in trading and investment activities. By offering access to a broader range of digital assets and advanced trading options, Kraken hopes to capitalize on this interest and provide Dutch users with a world-class trading experience. BCM’s existing customers are expected to benefit greatly from the acquisition, as they will gain access to Kraken’s advanced features and global liquidity. Kraken’s well-established infrastructure will allow Dutch users to trade with greater efficiency and security, benefiting from the platform’s robust trading engine and state-of-the-art security measures. Additionally, Kraken’s global presence will enable Dutch users to tap into a larger pool of liquidity, enhancing their trading opportunities.

                            One of OpenAI's official accounts just got hacked. OpenAI Newsroom, "The official newsroom for OpenAI", shared the following scam post on X on Monday. “We’re very happy to announce $OPEANAI [sic]: the gap between Al and blockchain technology,” it read. “All OpenAI users are eligible to claim a piece of $OPENAI’s initial supply. Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs.” Tweet may have been deleted Oh dear. The post has now been deleted, but clicking it took people to a phishing website that asked them to connect their crypto wallet in order to claim the non-existent "$OPENAI" token, per Techcrunch. Usually a scam like this would result in victims' wallets being drained after they connect and sign a malicious transaction. This isn't the first time OpenAI has fallen victim to hacks. The individual accounts of key employees, including CTO Mira Murati, chief scientist Jakub Pachocki, and researcher Jason Wei, have all previously been compromised and used to promote fake tokens. Tweet may have been deleted OpenAI itself was hacked in 2023, with the criminal allegedly making off with sensitive information obtained from an employee forum. Mashable has reached out to OpenAI with additional questions and we will update this article if we hear back.

                    Top 3 Crypto predictions for 2025: Solana to soar 300%, Dogecoin bulls eyeing a push to $1, Rexas Finance (RXS) to rocket from under $0.08 to $10
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            There is an expectation for a historic bull run in the cryptocurrency market within the year 2025, and several analysts project that key digital assets will grow at a staggeringly rapid rate. Key among such cryptocurrencies expected to perform exceptionally well in the years to come include Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the new Rexas Finance (RXS). Let’s analyze the potential of each token and why it could offer tremendous returns by 2025. Projection of Solana (SOL) price changes: Possible growth of 300% Solana has proven itself in terms of both time and scale and has already begun to be regarded as one of the best layer-one blockchains. A variety of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi markets were attracted by the low latency and the low costs of transactions. Solana is currently trading at around $150 for now. However, the asset’s price forecast is more promising due to the growing availability of institutional investors and developers. Some observers maintain that by the year 2025, Solana would be due to the 300% increase from the present price, the reason being that Solana price could scale to the $600−$750 range. Solana is positioned for growth because of the adoption of the Firedancer technology that enables it to process one million transactions in one second. Thus it bears skepticism that the price of Solana will remain as it is, new dimensions of the price will be reached due to the adoption of Solana by many developers and companies focusing on high-frequency trading. Dogecoin (DOGE): Doge set its sight on $1 What was once a rather funny joke has grown in relevance as a form of cryptocurrency. Linked to graphics and backers such as Elon Musk who is very popular in the market, Dogecoin has an active fan base. It has been hovering around a price of about $0.1 during the past year, and so many traders are willing to bet it will move to the price target of $1 before the year 2025. While this sounds rather unrealistic, this is the next bull market, and if adopted in real-world payment systems as intended, we could see a rise in value. Many believe that one day, almost everyone will use DOGE, and Dogecoin will finally benefit from how Twitter will help in mass adoption, sending the price to that coveted $1 figure. This is bound to be a high-return investment for anyone who buys into the market at these price levels. Rexas Finance (RXS): The real sector asset Tokenization maestro In particular, projects that are new to the market, like Rexas Finance (RXS), are among the most promising in terms of further expansion. Focused on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance is creating a hybrid between classic assets and distributed ledger technologies by enabling the tokenization of real estate, fine art, commodities, and other asset classes. This innovation enables investors to step into previously inaccessible capital markets, making the token enticing for both retail and institutional investors. During its presale, it is being offered for $0.05 and many expect that it will reach the market upwards of $10 by the year 2025 which in itself is a whopping 25,000% increase from its current level. The project has raised more than $1,000,000 million in its preliminary phase of presale suggesting that there is clearly much interest in the project and it would most likely be a high flyer in the short run. Most of the meme tokens in the cryptocurrency market are aimed at speculators but this one is focused on users and investors, therefore, it is more efficient. Conclusion: Glaring opportunity for strong growth Looking ahead to the year 2025, it is possible to identify different scenarios for Solana, Dogecoin, and Rexas Finance where investor returns can be quite substantial. Solana is expected to remain a leading blockchain, with forecasts of a 300% surge, and many institutional followers remain optimistic about its potential. Dogecoin, carried by its fans and potential real-world use cases, could confidently hit the elusive $1 level. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance, in particular, may provide the best opportunity by positioning itself as a top asset tokenization cryptocurrency.

                    US SEC, Coinbase clash in court over crypto rulemaking
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Coinbase (COIN.O) and the US securities regulator faced off in a federal appeals court in Philadelphia this week as the cryptocurrency exchange pressed the agency to create new rules for digital assets. Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission last year in an effort to compel the regulator to act on a petition for rulemaking Coinbase filed in 2022. In that petition, it urged the SEC to provide clarity on circumstances under which a digital asset is a security and create a new market structure framework compatible with cryptocurrencies. The SEC denied Coinbase’s petition for new rulemaking in December 2023, saying it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are “unworkable” for the crypto sector. Coinbase on Monday asked a federal appeals court to overturn that denial, saying the SEC has made it impossible for the crypto firm to operate and comply with US regulations. Eugene Scalia, a lawyer for Coinbase, told the three-judge appeals court the SEC had been arbitrary and capricious in not giving Coinbase more answers on how to register with the agency and comply with US laws. A lawyer for the SEC argued that the agency is not required to create a new rule for the sector, and that existing regulations should suffice. “If Coinbase wants to arrange its business in a way that does not comply with the existing regulatory framework, that does not establish a right to have the framework adapted to meet their business,” SEC lawyer Ezekiel Hill said. The three appeals court judges heard arguments from both sides, noting the SEC does have discretion in rulemaking priorities but also pressing the regulator on why cryptocurrency was not one of them. The dispute is the latest in a broader tug-of-war between the crypto sector and the top US markets regulator, which has repeatedly said most crypto tokens are securities and subject to its jurisdiction. The agency has sued several crypto companies, including Coinbase, for listing and trading crypto tokens which it says should be registered as securities. Coinbase denies those allegations and is fighting them in a separate court case. The crypto industry largely believes it operates in a regulatory gray area not governed by existing US securities laws, and that new legislation is needed to regulate the sector.

                    Harris Backs Crypto: 5 Ways To Leverage It For Her Opportunity Economy

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event Friday, ... [+] Sept. 20, 2024, in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. As Vice President Kamala Harris edges closer to a potential 2024 presidential win, her "Opportunity Economy" platform may present middle America with new avenues to engage with technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. While these financial technologies have often been framed as either the shadowy domain of criminals or Lambo driving crypto bros, Harris has the chance to carve out a balanced path between naysayers and carnival barkers—empowering Americans, and America, to thrive in the emerging Web3 economy. During a recent New York fundraiser, Harris made her most direct comments on crypto yet, promising to “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors.” Some industry leaders, like Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, expressed cautious optimism. Shirzad acknowledged via X/Twitter that such public statements are a clear departure from the Biden Administration’s regulatory wild west. However, the post comments show that others seek more than reassurances. Still others are under believe wrongly that because Harris is the current Vice President that she must implement new laws and policies immediately, showing a complete failure to of basic civics; namely the role of the Vice President and the three coequal branches of government. Despite being in the race for just six weeks, with only seven more to go, Harris’s platform is already being compared former President Donald Trump’s sudden embrace of bitcoin, and his promise to be the “crypto president”. During his four years in office, however, Trump did little to support the growth of these technologies, launching what became the Treasury Department’s Operation Hidden Treasure—the precursor to the more expansive anti-crypto Chokepoint 2.0, and publicly denouncing bitcoin as little more than a speculative asset used to fuel illegal activities. Moreover, his recent embrace of crypto has raised eyebrows. His family's newly announced DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, targeting accredited investors so close to the election, is sparking concerns about motives, ethics, and optics. Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as a response to failing governments, collapsing banks, and a loss of confidence in big business. Today, people are once again turning to crypto—not as a speculative asset for the elite, but as a tool for economic empowerment, leveling the playing field for everyone else. MORE FOR YOU Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, September 24 WWE Raw Recap: Jey Uso Wins His 1st Singles Title, Social Media Reacts Steady Surge Has New York Yankees On Verge Of AL East Title Over Baltimore Orioles The question for Harris, in this critical phase of a hotly contested presidential race, is: How can she break from President Biden's anti-crypto policies, executed by various regulators and oversight committees, and articulate a digital assets platform that aligns the economic needs of everyday Americans with the future opportunities in the rapidly evolving Web3 economy? How Digital Assets Can Power The "Opportunity Economy" Harris’s Opportunity Economy focuses on reducing inequality, empowering small businesses, and fostering entrepreneurship—objectives that align with decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers more than just wealth-building for the rich; it provides banking access to the unbanked, facilitates remittances, and lowers financial transaction costs, supporting Harris’s vision of an inclusive economy for families and small businesses. DeFi platforms and stablecoins are especially important for immigrants sending remittances, as crypto transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional wire transfers. Expanding crypto-friendly policies could help lower- and middle-income families benefit from these innovations. The results of a July 2024 Paradigm Democratic poll underscore the appeal of cryptocurrency within diverse communities. The survey found that 22% of Black Democrats, 25% of Hispanic Democrats, and 27% of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Democrats have purchased cryptocurrency—higher percentages than their white counterparts. Additionally, 28% of Black Democrats and 32% of Hispanic Democrats view crypto as playing a positive role in the U.S. economy. These statistics highlight an opportunity for Harris to tap into a base of voters already exploring decentralized financial systems as an alternative to traditional banking barriers. The demand for crypto as a means of leveling the financial playing field is significant. A March 2024 DCG/Harris Poll found that 80% of voters believe the current financial system favors elites, while 79% argue it lacks transparency. For many, cryptocurrency represents a pathway toward greater financial equity, with 77% of crypto-positive voters agreeing that crypto helps level the playing field. Harris’s Opportunity Economy message aligns with these sentiments, making it essential for her to continue engaging with this constituency. Bridging The Gap For Everyday Users The crypto community is closely watching Harris’s approach, as skepticism grows around Donald Trump’s crypto promises. His recently launched DeFi platform, accessible only to accredited investors and with a 20% token reserve for family members, raises concerns that his initiatives favor the Trump family and wealthy investors, over ordinary citizens. His claim that bitcoin could settle national debt has also drawn criticism for its impracticality. In contrast, Harris’s Opportunity Economy offers a more inclusive vision, benefiting not just institutions but also small businesses and immigrants using crypto for remittances. A balanced regulatory framework under her leadership could ensure cryptocurrencies serve the public without sacrificing consumer protections. With 19% of American voters—and even higher percentages in communities of color—owning cryptocurrency, Harris’s policies must focus on supporting everyday users, not just large investors. A Call For Concrete Action The crypto community is pushing for more than general statements from Harris. With Trump taking a more active role in engaging the industry—speaking at major events and embracing a pro-crypto stance—Harris faces mounting pressure to provide specific policy details. Harris’s challenge is to convince multi-issue pro-crypto voters that her administration will offer the regulatory clarity and innovation-friendly policies they seek while avoiding the pitfalls of her opponent's legally dubious promises. Stand With Crypto tweet on 9/23/2024 at 5:19 pm announcing VP Harris's "somewhat supportive" ... [+] statements on crypto. Twitter screentshot Industry groups like Stand with Crypto provide a potential roadmap, advocating for direct engagement with the legislative process to ensure individual users' needs are prioritized in future policymaking. Policies That Benefit Main Street, Not Just Wall Street Harris has an opportunity to build on the original vision of bitcoin, which was created as a response to an economic crisis and a breakdown of trust in traditional financial systems. To do so, she will need to outline a regulatory framework that benefits the people who need it most. Here are five steps Harris could take to ensure her policies serve Main Street, not just Wall Street: Create a Regulatory Framework That Protects Small Users: Harris could advocate for clear distinctions between personal crypto transactions and those conducted by large financial institutions, ensuring that small users—such as individuals using crypto for remittances—are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as corporate actors. Expand Financial Access Through DeFi: By promoting DeFi platforms, Harris could expand access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked. This includes supporting low-cost, crypto-based remittances and peer-to-peer lending. Support Blockchain Solutions for Small Businesses: Blockchain can reduce transaction fees and improve transparency for small businesses, particularly those in middle America looking to compete globally. Invest in Digital Literacy for Everyday Americans: By prioritizing blockchain education in public schools and community colleges, Harris could ensure that everyday Americans have the knowledge to safely and confidently engage with the digital economy. Avoid Regulatory Overreach That Stifles Innovation: Harris must advocate for balanced regulations that protect consumers without crushing innovation. This would include providing clearer guidelines for individual crypto users, ensuring they are not unduly penalized or caught in a web of overregulation. Why Harris’s Crypto Policy Matters For Everyday Americans Harris’s campaign rhetoric offers hope to everyday cryptocurrency users, but the community is looking for concrete action. Cryptocurrencies, born out of an economic crisis, now represent a chance for financial inclusion and empowerment—not just for institutions or the wealthy. Harris’s Opportunity Economy could pave the way for a new era of financial inclusion, enabling regular people to benefit from blockchain technology. In a polarized political climate, pro-crypto policies could unify young, diverse, and financially marginalized voters—key demographics for Harris. By aligning her crypto policies with financial empowerment, Harris could position herself as a leader in the digital economy, where blockchain and DeFi become tools for opportunity and equity.

                    Coinbase Locks Horns with US SEC in Court Over Crypto Rulemaking

                            Coinbase and the US securities regulator faced off in a federal appeals court in Philadelphia on Monday as the cryptocurrency exchange pressed the agency to create new rules for digital assets. Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission last year in an effort to compel the regulator to act on a petition for rulemaking Coinbase filed in 2022. In that petition, it urged the SEC to provide clarity on circumstances under which a digital asset is a security and create a new market structure framework compatible with cryptocurrencies.How Hong Kong’s CBDC Roadmap Resembles RBI's Approach with eRupee The SEC denied Coinbase's petition for new rulemaking in December 2023, saying it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are "unworkable" for the crypto sector. Coinbase on Monday asked a federal appeals court to overturn that denial, saying the SEC has made it impossible for the crypto firm to operate and comply with US regulations. Eugene Scalia, a lawyer for Coinbase, told the three-judge appeals court the SEC had been arbitrary and capricious in not giving Coinbase more answers on how to register with the agency and comply with US laws.World Liberty Financial: Trump Unveils Crypto Biz, Offers Little Detail A lawyer for the SEC argued that the agency is not required to create a new rule for the sector, and that existing regulations should suffice. "If Coinbase wants to arrange its business in a way that does not comply with the existing regulatory framework, that does not establish a right to have the framework adapted to meet their business," SEC lawyer Ezekiel Hill said. The three appeals court judges heard arguments from both sides, noting the SEC does have discretion in rulemaking priorities but also pressing the regulator on why cryptocurrency was not one of them. The dispute is the latest in a broader tug-of-war between the crypto sector and the top U.S. markets regulator, which has repeatedly said most crypto tokens are securities and subject to its jurisdiction. The agency has sued several crypto companies, including Coinbase, for listing and trading crypto tokens which it says should be registered as securities. Coinbase denies those allegations and is fighting them in a separate court case. The crypto industry largely believes it operates in a regulatory gray area not governed by existing US securities laws, and that new legislation is needed to regulate the sector. © Thomson Reuters 2024 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

                    Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto are Surging-- and Tax Policy Can Help

                            Opinion by Shafik Hebous, Nate Vernon-Lin (washington dc)Tuesday, September 24, 2024Inter Press Service As the Chart of the Week shows, crypto mining and data centers together accounted for 2 percent of world electricity demand in 2022. And that share is likely to climb to 3.5 percent in three years, according to our estimates based on projections from the International Energy Agency. That would be equivalent to current consumption of Japan, the world's fifth largest electricity user. The climate impact of these activities—irrespective of their social and economic benefits—is cause for concern. A recent IMF working paper found that crypto mining could generate 0.7 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions by 2027. Extending the analysis to data centers (based on IEA estimates), means their carbon emissions could reach 450 million tons by 2027, or 1.2 percent of the world total. The tax system is one way to steer companies toward curbing emissions. According to IMF estimates, a direct tax of $0.047 per kilowatt hour would drive the crypto mining industry to curb its emissions in line with global goals. If considering air pollution's impact on local health as well, that tax rate would rise to $0.089, translating into an 85 percent increase in average electricity price for miners. Such a levy would raise annual government revenue of $5.2 billion globally and reduce annual emissions by 100 million tons (around Belgium's current emissions). For data centers, a targeted tax on their electricity use would need to be set at $0.032 per kilowatt hour, or $0.052 including air pollution costs. It is slightly lower than for crypto because data centers tend to be in locations with greener electricity. This could raise as much as $18 billion annually. The situation today is the opposite: many data centers and crypto miners enjoy generous tax exemptions and incentives on income, consumption, and property. Considering the environmental damage, the lack of significant employment, and pressures on the electrical grid (possibly raising prices for households and reducing demand for the use of other low emissions goods, such as electric vehicles), the net benefits of these special tax regimes are unclear at best. Policy incentives On the flip side, AI applications could lead to smarter and more efficient power use, which some have posited could help ease electricity demand. The right policies can still incentivize developing AI applications with positive societal spillovers while addressing the environmental damage. For policymakers, a broad carbon price coordinated across countries would be the best way to curb emissions, because it would encourage reduced fossil-fuel consumption, cleaner power sources, and improved energy efficiency. To limit global warming to 2 degrees, countries would need to introduce additional measures equivalent to a carbon price rising to $85 per ton by 2030. In the absence of a global carbon price, targeted measures could encourage crypto miners and data centers to use more energy-efficient equipment and may even motivate the adoption of less energy intensive crypto mining. Complementing electricity taxes with credits for zero-emission, bilateral power purchase agreements, and potentially renewable energy certificates would also help. Cross-border coordination also remains important, as stricter measures in one location could encourage relocation to jurisdictions with lower standards. As the window of opportunity for containing rising temperatures rapidly closes, expanding renewable energy sources and adopting an appropriate carbon price are urgently needed. In the interim, targeted measures, including taxation, can help mitigate increasing emissions from crypto mining and data centers.

                    Lawmaker, Crypto Community Troll Gary Gensler Ahead Of Congress SEC Oversight Hearing
                </h3>

                            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is due to appear before the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, but hours before his testimony at the oversight hearing, the cryptocurrency industry's "nemesis" is already getting bad vibes from the crypto community.Gensler has been on the receiving end of negativity in recent years from crypto users, but things have gone a notch higher earlier this year as a growing number of lawmakers have been questioning his leadership and the SEC's regulatory approach toward digital assets.An 'Opportunity' To Step Down?As soon as the SEC chief announced his congressional appearances this week on X, crypto users on the platform gathered in the comments section to share their thoughts.Non-fungible token (NFT) collector Medic Matt said an appearance at Congress would be a "great opportunity to resign," echoing some calls from the community for Gensler to leave the SEC chairmanship to someone more capable.Prominent crypto researcher Anderson said he is looking forward to watching Gensler "not answering any question whatsoever and just waste everyone's time."Anderson was referring to a 2023 hearing wherein Gensler repeatedly refused to answer lawmakers' questions regarding Ethereum's status as a security or a commodity.Crypto YouTuber James Rule asked whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will be "scripting the answers" for Gensler. Warren and Gensler have been accused of purposefully working toward the destruction of the crypto industry.Crypto investor and developer Leon Gaban said the SEC should just be shut down. "Quit now, before you get fired later," he urged Gensler, whom Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he will fire on his first day if elected in November.One user said Gensler wouldn't be anywhere near Congress or at the mercy of proclaimed pro-crypto lawmakers if the SEC, under his leadership, "didn't sue Ripple."The SEC filed a lawsuit against digital assets payment protocol Ripple over the latter's alleged sales of unregistered token securities. Since the 2020 lawsuit, Ripple fought the SEC hard in court and last month, the legal scuffle ended with a $125 million civil penalty on the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency.While the penalty was on Ripple, many experts believe the SEC lost the battle, since the Wall Street regulator wanted a staggering $2 billion fine against the fintech giant.Crypto analyst Jonathan Morgan reminded Gensler that his "Democrat allies" can no longer "malign" the crypto industry due to its massive growth that an increasing number of Republican politicians have acknowledged."They're going to throw you under the bus because it's politically expedient to distance themselves from your war against crypto," Morgan said.Lawmaker Seeks AccountabilityHouse Republican Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota reposted Gensler's announcement of his Congress testimony schedule. "Looking forward to holding your feet to the fire," Emmer wrote, using #FireGaryGensler.Emmer's statements were made just days after he, alongside Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, pressed Gensler to provide regulatory clarity on airdropped tokens."The SEC's approach during your time as Chair has only ensured that the next iteration of the internet is not designed by Americans or with American values, which is not to the benefit of our constituents," they wrote in a letter last week.Aside from his House hearing appearance, Gensler will also testify at the Senate's Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday.

                            An official OpenAI account on X was taken over to peddle a cryptocurrency scam on Monday evening. On Monday at 6:24PM ET, the @OpenAINewsroom account, which shares news from OpenAI and has nearly 54,000 followers, made a now-deleted post advertising an “$OPENAI” token. “We’re very happy to announce $OPEANAI: the token bridging the gap between Al and blockchain technology,” the post said. “All OpenAI users are eligible to claim a piece of $OPENAI’s initial supply. Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs.” The post also included a link to a spoofed version of OpenAI’s website at a URL that wasn’t openai.com.

As of this writing, the OpenAI Newsroom account hasn’t posted anything to explain what might have happened. The account launched at the beginning of this month.

                    Crypto scammers hack OpenAI’s press account on X

                            OpenAI’s official press account on X was compromised by cryptocurrency scammers. Or, at least that’s what appears to have happened. Late Monday afternoon, OpenAI Newsroom, an account OpenAI recently launched to spotlight product- and policy-related announcements, posted about a supposedly new OpenAI-branded blockchain token, “$OPENAI.” “[$OPEANAI bridges] the gap between Al and blockchain technology,” the post read. “All OpenAI users are eligible to claim a piece of $OPENAI’s initial supply. Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs.” The trouble is, $OPENAI doesn’t exist — and the post on X linked to a phishing site designed to mimic the legitimate OpenAI website (minus the conspicuous URL “token-openai.com”). A prominent “CLAIM $OPENAI” button on the fake site encouraged unsuspecting users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets, likely in an attempt to steal those users’ login credentials. As of publication time, both the post and site were still up. And comments on the malicious OpenAI Newsroom post were disabled, making the hack less obvious than it might be otherwise. It’s not the first time accounts associated with OpenAI have been compromised as a part of phishing campaigns. In June 2023, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s account posted a similar message promoting the fictional $OPENAI crypto token. And just three months ago, the accounts of OpenAI chief scientist Jakub Pachocki and OpenAI researcher Jason Wei were hacked and used to publish scam posts identical to the post on the OpenAI Newsroom account today. Coinspeaker, reporting on the hack of Murati’s account last June, said that the scammers used a “crypto drainer” tool that would funnel all the NFTs and tokens that victims had in their wallets to the scammers’ wallet once they signed into the fake OpenAI site. Other high-profile X accounts belonging to tech companies and celebrities have been hacked in recent years to promote crypto scams.

                    The zombie Flappy Bird saga gets weirder: 'The game will never have NFTs' but it does have Web3 features and you can only play it through Telegram, which doesn't seem great
                </h3>

                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The Flappy Bird comeback announced earlier this month seemed a little unfortunate beneath the surface. "A new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world" sounds innocuous enough, but there was no overlooking the complete lack of involvement on the part of creator Dong Nguyen, and the group's acquisition of the Flappy Bird trademark had, as senior editor Rich Stanton put it at the time, "a slight whiff of skullduggery": Legally copacetic, but maybe a little dodgy. Shortly thereafter questions about the resurrected game being an NFT joint floated to the surface, which the Flappy Bird Foundation, as the group is known, did not address in a "clear the air" post on Twitter last week, which focused exclusively on the trademark acquisition. Now it has, sort of, although honestly I'm just more confused than ever: In a new tweet, the Flappy Bird folks say players will "have the option to use Web3 features," but also promises that "the game will never have NFTs." "Web3" is sort of a catch-all term for an envisioned future of the internet built on blockchain technology, maybe with some sort of cryptocurrency integration. The Harvard Business Review describes it as "a convenient shorthand for the project of rewiring how the web works, using blockchain to change how information is stored, shared, and owned," while the Canadian Web3 Council says it "uses blockchain technology, like the one behind cryptocurrencies, to create a more open and fair internet where users have more control over their data and online activities." So, you get the idea: it's blockchain. How exactly Flappy Bird will integrate Web3 technology isn't made clear, nor is there any justification for the embrace of blockchain alongside a clear rejection of NFTs. It could be simply that the term NFT is radioactive at this point—despite the best efforts of C-list celebrities and Ubisoft, NFTs are not exactly flying high these days. Regardless, it's a confusing point without clarity from the Flappy Bird Foundation, and thus far that clarity has not been forthcoming. And while NFTs may be out, cryptocurrency is not. A Web3 wallet may not be required to play but as noted by BlockchainGamer.biz, Flappy Bird relaunched with a "Flap-a-TON" event that enabled players to mint "Flappy tokens" on Telegram's TON (The Open Network) blockchain. That's quite a community note, eh? The new Flappy Bird is currently playable exclusively on Telegram, which for me is a red flag all on its own due to the platform's popularity with everything from right-wing extremist groups to illegal pornographers and drug kingpins. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested by French authorities in August on charges including "complicity in the organized gang distribution of images of minors of a child pornographic nature, drug trafficking, organized gang fraud, criminal conspiracy to commit crimes or misdemeanors," and various other such things. Taken altogether, it's not a great picture: A trademark yoinked away from its original owner, brought back to life with much fanfare and no mention of new crypto foundations, and playable only through a social network that's especially big amongst the Proud Boys and Patriot Front. To be clear, there's no evidence of wrongdoing of any sort, and it may be exactly as presented: Mindless screen-tapping for people who want to make the bird flap, token grinding for those into the crypto scene, and never the twain shall meet. But right now it all feels sort of greasy, a perception that isn't helped by the Flappy Bird Foundation's slow-drip release of incomplete information. I've reached out to the Flappy Bird Foundation for more information and will update if I receive a reply.

                    Bitcoin’s 7.3% Monthly Gain: Miners Hold Coins as Supply Tightens

                            Bitcoin’s value soared last week, riding a wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 0.5 points sparked enthusiasm among investors. This move boosted risk assets, including cryptocurrencies and tech stocks, leading to significant gains for Bitcoin. On Friday, Bitcoin ETFs saw a substantial influx of $92 million, according to Farside data. Ark Investments’ ARKB led the pack with $22 million in inflows, followed closely by Bitwise’s BITB at $15.1 million. Surprisingly, BlackRock‘s IBIT, the largest in the segment, didn’t attract any new investments that day. Over the weekend, Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between $62,000 and $63,000, despite low trading volumes. Ethereum’s native currency, Ether, also saw gains, hovering around $2,600. This upward trend aligns with the broader rush towards risky assets in the market. Julio Andreoni, a cryptocurrency expert at Bitybank, advises investors to stay alert to Fed members’ statements and PCE inflation data. These factors could significantly impact investor sentiment in the coming days. Andreoni also noted a record-breaking hash rate for Bitcoin, suggesting a potential price increase. Cryptocurrency Market on the Rise Since September, Bitcoin has been on a strong upward trajectory. Miners are holding onto their coins instead of selling, reducing market supply and potentially driving up prices. This trend, combined with the recent gains, paints a promising picture for Bitcoin’s future value. As of 11:11 AM Brasília time, Bitcoin was up 1.6% in the last 24 hours, trading at $63,438. Ether also saw gains, rising 3.2% to $2,657. The total cryptocurrency market cap reached an impressive $2.32 trillion. Bernardo Bonjean, founder of Metrix, believes the expectation of further interest rate cuts will boost confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. He also noted that 87 of the top 100 tokens closed the week with gains, indicating a positive trend for altcoins as well. The recent developments in the cryptocurrency market paint a picture of growing investor confidence and potential for further gains. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin and other digital assets are positioning themselves as increasingly attractive investment options.

                    Company moves into former crypto mine that Biden ordered to leave for national security concerns

                            CHEYENNE (Tribune News Service) — In May, the Biden administration ordered a crypto-mining operation in Cheyenne to divest due to its proximity to F.E. Warren Air Force Base and national security concerns associated with speculations about the business’s ties to the Chinese government. In August, it was announced that the property, located in Front Range Business Park, was acquired by CleanSpark, an American bitcoin infrastructure company. Earlier this week, the company met with the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology to present updates on their recent acquisition. “So, I said it to you in person, and I’ll say it here on the record: We really want you here, and we really deeply appreciate everything you’re investing in Wyoming, and we want to facilitate that to the greatest extent that we can,” committee co-Chairman Rep. Cyrus Western, R-Big Horn, said to CleanSpark CEO and President Zach Bradford during Monday’s meeting. CleanSpark officially acquired the property late last week when it received permission from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFIUS), the same organization that ordered the previous owners to divest, to close on the property. Company leaders report they will utilize 45 megawatts of energy to power their Bitcoin mining operations. This is in addition to a facility CleanSpark acquired in August at the Campstool Business Park that will use 30 MW, for a total of an anticipated 75 MW footprint in Wyoming by the end of 2024, equivalent to the energy needed to power approximately 62,500 homes, based on the average American household energy consumption. According to a press release from CleanSpark, the company is actively working to expand the available power at the 30 MW site to further increase operational capacity. Though they have not publicly stated where they will source the energy for the operations or whether they will try to increase energy consumption there, as well, the former owner of the land at Front Range Business Park, MineOne Partners Limited, previously told the WTE that their Bitcoin mining operation had an energy agreement with Black Hills Energy to deliver up to 45 MW of electric service, with potential to expand to 75 MW. “What we have found in the way that we engage in all states that we go into is that it’s about being a partner with the utility,” Bradford said in reference to his company’s first business endeavors in Wyoming. He said he refers to this as his “front door approach.” So far, Bradford said CleanSpark has invested a little over $25 million in the properties to date and expects to invest an additional $40 million to $50 million in infrastructure, such as substations, over the next three to six months at both properties. After that, he said they will designate at least another $100 million for servers. He estimates this will create close to 40 jobs between the two properties. “So, we want to be in areas and places with abundant power or power that has intermittent needs that we, and the community at large, can benefit from our participation in,” Bradford said. He said they also plan to invest in further infrastructure, such as substations. The company hopes to replicate some of the work they have done in the four other states they have a presence, including Georgia. “Our intention and our hope is just like we did in Georgia,” he said, “where Georgia was a net (energy) export state and still is. It allowed that power to stay in-state and generate jobs and tax dollars inside the state lines.” Bradford told the committee he hopes his company will continue to expand throughout Wyoming.

                    US SEC, Coinbase clash in court over crypto rulemaking
                </h3>

                            Coinbase and the U.S. securities regulator faced off in a federal appeals court in Philadelphia on Monday as the cryptocurrency exchange presses the agency to create new rules for digital assets. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission last year in an effort to compel the regulator to act on a petition for rulemaking it filed in 2022. In that petition, it urged the SEC to provide clarity on the circumstances under which a digital asset is a security and create a new market structure framework that is compatible with cryptocurrencies. The SEC denied Coinbase's petition for new rulemaking in December 2023, with the commission saying it would not propose new rules because it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are "unworkable" for the crypto sector. Coinbase on Monday asked a federal appeals court to overturn that denial, saying the SEC has made it impossible for the crypto firm to operate and comply with U.S. regulations. The dispute is the latest in a broader tug-of-war between the crypto sector and the top U.S. markets regulator, which has repeatedly said most crypto tokens are securities and subject to its jurisdiction. The agency has sued several crypto companies, including Coinbase, for listing and trading crypto tokens which it says should be registered as securities. Coinbase denies those allegations and is fighting them in a separate court case. The crypto industry largely believes it operates in a regulatory gray area not governed by existing U.S. securities laws, and that new legislation is needed to regulate the sector.

                    Crypto Miner Truce Leaves Open the Possibility of Riot Taking Over Bitfarms

                            “The agreement still leaves the door open for future possibilities, should Riot wish to revisit the idea of a takeover under more favorable conditions,” said Matthew Kimmell, digital asset analyst at CoinShares. A spokesperson for Castle Rock, Colorado-based Riot declined to comment beyond the press release. Toronto-based Bitfarms didn’t immediately response to a request for comment. Riot’s unsolicited $950 million offer to buy Bitfarms was rebuffed by the smaller rival in April. Bitfarms ended up adopting a “poison pill” defense strategy to prevent hostile takeovers as Riot continued to buy up its shares. Amy Freedman, one of Riot three nominees, will join the board. Bitfarms will also elect an independent director as its sixth board member at the special shareholders meeting later this year. Two co-founders of Bitfarms have departed from the board since Riot launched its takeover bid. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners spend billions of dollars on specialized computers and electricity to validate encrypted transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn rewards in the form of the token. The sector has seen increasing consolidation as revenue for such companies plummets due to an April software update in Bitcoin. Called the halving, the blockchain is preprogrammed to reduce Bitcoin rewards by 50% every four years to maintain its hard cap of 21 million.

                    The Trumps want to make crypto ‘user-friendly’. Here’s what you need to know about the venture that has Barron as its ‘visionary’
                </h3>

                            "You can literally sell s*** in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s right, because people will buy it.” So said internet marketer and self-professed "dirtbag" Chase Herro from the driver’s seat of his Rolls-Royce in a 2018 YouTube video, according to Bloomberg News. Six years later, Herro is one of the brains behind a new cryptocurrency venture backed by none other by Donald Trump and his three sons. The elder sons Don Jr and Eric are leading the promotion, although supposedly it is 18-year-old Barron who will serve as the project’s "visionary"." In a live broadcast on the social network X on Monday night, Don Jr billed the project – known as World Liberty Financial (WLF) – as "the start of a financial revolution", while Eric said it would challenge the power of big traditional banks by making crypto as smoothly hospitable to ordinary Americans as one of the Trumps’ famous hotels. "If there’s one contribution I want to make to the world of crypto, it’s actually making it user-friendly," said Eric. "We better damn well embrace [crypto] as a country, because it’s coming,” Eric continued. “And the people who are ignoring it – the people who don’t want to figure it out, who don’t want to make the effort – they’re going to be left behind. "But at the same time, it’s truly our job to make it understandable... we have to make it intuitive. We have to make it user-friendly. And we will." How WLF actually plans to do that, and indeed what exactly WLF is, remained mysterious even at the end of the two-hour livestream. But based on what little we know so far, crypto experts interviewed by The Independent were skeptical that the Trumps would protect its users from the scammers and criminals who swarm through the cryptocurrency ecosystem (related: Donald Trump, his older sons and the Trump Organization have been ordered to pay $454m for a civil suit in New York related to financial fraud). But can the Trumps and their business partners achieve what many in the industry have struggled for years to do and achieve Eric’s goal of making crypto understandable and accessible? "You’ve got tens of thousands of people that have raised billions and billions of dollars, that are all trying to solve that problem: how do I make my crypto transactions as easy as my transactions on my credit card?" says Zach Hamilton, a longtime crypto venture capitalist and founder of the crypto-powered document storage firm Cache Legal. "It’s an incredibly hard problem to solve… I don’t really want to speculate on if it could be successful or not, because it doesn’t exist yet. Maybe they’ve got some secret sauce; I doubt it." As Don Jr told it, his eyes were opened to the world of cryptocurrency and "decentralized finance" – or DeFi for short – when conventional banks withdrew services from the Trump family due to their political activities. "We went from being the elite in that world to just being totally canceled, and it changed our perspective so much," he said on Monday. "When you really look at the way our founding fathers set everything up, I think DeFi is what they would envision – not a broken, bureaucratized system where a bunch of middlemen are getting pieces for doing nothing." These and other statements from people involved with WLF, and leaked draft documents obtained by the crypto news site CoinDesk, suggest that WLF wants to build a decentralized crypto borrowing and lending system. In traditional finance, transactions are executed and verified by a small number of powerful institutions such as banks or credit card companies. When you send ordinary money (called fiat money) across national borders, no currency actually moves; rather, the sending and receiving institutions simply agree to adjust their records of what you own and where. Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, are different. They are essentially software networks running simultaneously on many computers around the world, which execute transactions collectively by working together to verify each other’s identity and check each other’s math. In principle, that means no government agent or bank employee can ever block or reverse a crypto transaction. The big exception is cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Coinbase and Binance) that let you convert fiat money into crypto or vice versa, which are consequently required to follow banking law in most major economies. But WLF probably isn’t building an exchange, according to Zach Hamilton. Those are too expensive and too difficult to set up. Instead he suspects they will modify (or "fork") an existing crypto lending protocol such as Aave, which uses self-enforcing "smart contracts" to execute and collect loans without any human oversight. This is not a new idea. "There are a number of prominent DeFi borrowing and lending platforms that have operated for years in crypto, that were built by very well respected teams, where the resilience of the smart contracts and technology has been proven by their durability and popularity," says Gareth Rhodes, a lawyer and former New York market regulator who now advises finance tech start-ups. "It’s an open question [what] WLF will add in terms of user experience or technology capabilities." In that regard, the WLF team’s track record is hardly promising. Although all four Trumps were given job titles in the draft white paper obtained by CoinDesk, it stressed that they will not own or manage WLF but may receive financial benefit from it. The real managers appear to be Herro and another businessman named Zachary Folkman, who are both listed, are best known for a previous DeFi lending system called Dough Finance. After attracting a few million dollars in transactions, it was hacked and had $2m stolen in July and is now reportedly inactive. According to a profile by Bloomberg News, Herro made his money through a string of internet marketing and coaching schemes, some of which appeared to flout Facebook’s advertising rules, while Folkman is a former pick-up artist who ran a seminar series called Date Hotter Girls. Neither Rhodes nor Hamilton said they had heard of Herro or Folkman. And none of the dozen-plus digital asset investors asked by Bloomberg had heard of them either. WLF and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Still, Hamilton says WLF does have one good asset. Forking a lending protocol like Aave is the easy part; that can be done "in an afternoon", from anywhere around the world The harder thing is to bring enough people into the service, and enough money, to provide the level of liquidity that will actually allow it to function as a market. "The one thing the Trump Organization has is the biggest megaphone in the world. Anything those people do will be covered ad nauseam by the media," says Hamilton. "You have to get people’s eyes on what you’re doing, and you have to convince them to move money." Even this, however, is only one half of the challenge facing WLF. Less than 24 hours after Monday’s livestream, the crypto lawyer and security expert Alexander Urbelis posted a list of no less than 41 fake web domains aping WLF’s address, likely from scammers looking to cash in on the hype. Indeed, earlier this month the X accounts of Donald Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump,30, and his daughter-in-law, Eric’s wife Lara Trump, were hijacked by apparent cybercriminals promoting a hoax WLF Telegram group, offering up to $15,000 worth of (doubtless illusory) cryptocurrency to anyone who connected a crypto wallet to their service. These shenanigans underline how rife the crypto ecosystem still is with scams, fraud, and theft. Losses reported to the FBI swelled from just under $4bn to nearly $6bn between 2022 and 2023. "My industry is not being honest, with the government or the general public, about the scale of cybercrime," says Rich Sanders, an independent crypto crime investigator who says he has spent the past two years busting Russian-affiliated crypto networks in Ukraine. Criminals love crypto precisely because it skips traditional middlemen. Transactions are irrevocable, usually unblockable, and safe trading often requires significant technical savvy. Outside of "custodial" services such as Coinbase, which hold crypto on your behalf much like a traditional bank, nobody is going to save you if you make a mistake or fall for a scam. And while nearly all crypto transactions are publicly traceable, it’s sometimes tough to find out the real identity of a given recipient. So if WLF wants to bring new, non-techie users into this risky world, how does it plan to protect them? "[With] security, you can never be perfect. You know, I think of security as more of a journey," said WLF adviser Corey Caplan on Monday. "So it’s really important for not just myself but this whole team to remain nimble, adapt, continue to soak up new information like a sponge," Both Rich Sanders and Zach Hamilton said that there is a zero-sum trade-off between making crypto newbie-safe and idiot-proof while simultaneously refusing to serve as a middleman or keep custody of users’ currency. "There’s nothing that WLF is doing that negates the reality that the consumer is going to be the one that holds the private keys. Because they can’t have consumer protection while being a non custodial service; both cannot be true," said Sanders. Yet both Sanders and Hamilton also said the impact would be limited because WLF is unlikely to actually attract many (or any) novices. Anyone choosing to use a decentralized lending protocol that cannot swap fiat money for crypto is already diving in at the deep end. Instead, Sanders claims that the whole project is really just a ploy for Donald Trump to curry favor from the crypto community. "WLF itself is barely worth discussing; it is inevitable vaporware," he says. "It doesn’t have a vision, doesn’t have a plan, doesn’t fulfil a need, doesn’t need to exist... this is for votes, nothing else." Indeed, when Trump visited a bitcoin bar in New York City and spoke to crypto enthusiasts about US monetary policy, crammed together with reporters under a low yet ornately tiled ceiling, it had the vibe of any other campaign stop. That’s not to say it couldn’t backfire. Nic Carter, a well-known pro-Trump crypto entrepreneur, has appealed to the community to find some way of stopping WLF’s launch, arguing that any successful hack or government investigation could damage the former president’s election campaign. Hamilton is more sanguine. He hopes that someone as controversial as Trump will at least draw the attention of regulators and force them to set clarifying precedents, illuminating what he describes as a still-murky legal landscape for crypto entrepreneurs. Still, he adds that a WLF hack, while probably not very damaging economically, would be a big reputational hit to the crypto industry. "I hope they’re doing their security right. I hope they’ve got all their audits done correctly," he says. If not, "it would make all of us look a little stupid."
