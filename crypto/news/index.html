Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF offers a convenient way to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly purchasing or holding the asset. This article breaks down what the FBTC ETF is, how it works and the key considerations for potential investors. I'll explain the mechanics of bitcoin ETFs, clarify how spot bitcoin ETFs differ from other investment vehicles, and dive into Fidelity’s specific offering. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of whether Fidelity's FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF is the right fit for your portfolio. Understanding Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow investors to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to buy, store or secure the bitcoin themselves. ETFs have long been a popular financial product, offering investors a way to track assets or baskets of assets, such as stocks, bonds or commodities. As bitcoin has become a more established asset, bitcoin ETFs have emerged as a means for investors to access this digital asset without directly holding or transferring bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC spot bitcoin ETF is a prime example of this innovation. What Is A Spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin by holding actual bitcoin in reserve. Unlike futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which derive their value from contracts predicting the future price of bitcoin, spot bitcoin ETFs aim to reflect the real-time price of bitcoin. Investors in a spot ETF gain exposure to bitcoin’s market performance, but without the complexities of wallet management, private key security or direct custody. MORE FOR YOU Google’s New Gmail App Password Rules—You Have 24 Hours To Comply Earth To Get A Comet, A Solar Eclipse, Aurora And A New Moon This Week Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Sunday, September 29 Fidelity’s FBTC is a spot bitcoin ETF, meaning it holds bitcoin directly in its portfolio, allowing it to mirror bitcoin’s price fluctuations in real time. How a Spot Bitcoin ETF Works A spot bitcoin ETF works by purchasing and holding bitcoin on behalf of its investors. In Fidelity’s case, the bitcoin is held by Fidelity Digital Asset Services, LLC (FDAS), which serves as the custodian. The fund’s value is tied to the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate, a composite index that tracks bitcoin prices across various exchanges using a volume-weighted median price (VWMP) calculation. This ensures that the ETF’s price closely follows the actual market value of bitcoin. For investors, buying shares of FBTC is as simple as purchasing shares of any other ETF, allowing for convenient access to bitcoin’s performance. Differences Between Spot Bitcoin ETFs And Futures Bitcoin ETFs Spot bitcoin ETFs and futures bitcoin ETFs differ primarily in how they gain exposure to bitcoin. While spot ETFs hold actual bitcoin, futures ETFs rely on contracts that speculate on the future price of bitcoin. This can lead to discrepancies between the ETF's value and the current market price of bitcoin. Spot ETFs like FBTC are generally seen as more straightforward for investors who want their investment to track bitcoin’s spot price closely, whereas futures ETFs are subject to contango, backwardation and other market phenomena that can affect their performance relative to spot prices. How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Track Prices Spot bitcoin ETFs track bitcoin prices by directly holding bitcoin and valuing it according to a market-based index. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF uses the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate, which aggregates bitcoin price data from multiple exchanges. This data is processed using a VWMP method, ensuring that the ETF reflects real-time bitcoin prices with accuracy. By utilizing this index, FBTC provides transparent and reliable tracking of bitcoin’s price in U.S. dollars, offering investors a consistent and clear view of their exposure. Benefits Of Spot Bitcoin ETFs For Investors Spot bitcoin ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC offer several benefits for investors. First, they provide a regulated and convenient way to invest in bitcoin without the need to navigate the complexities of wallets, private keys or cold storage. Additionally, since the ETF holds actual bitcoin, it tracks the asset’s price more closely than a futures-based ETF. For investors with traditional brokerage accounts, FBTC offers an easy way to diversify into bitcoin while benefiting from regulatory oversight and the trusted infrastructure of Fidelity Investments. What Is Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF? Fidelity’s FBTC spot bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded product designed to give investors exposure to bitcoin’s price movements. The ETF holds bitcoin directly and mirrors the value of bitcoin in real-time through its tracking of the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate. It is listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol “FBTC.” Fidelity’s reputation as a leading asset manager provides additional confidence for investors looking to enter the bitcoin market through a regulated and well-established financial institution. Details about FBTC, like most other publicly traded funds, are available in its prospectus. Overview Of Fidelity Investments Fidelity Investments is one of the largest financial institutions in the world, with over $4.5 trillion in assets under management. The company is known for its commitment to innovation, providing a wide range of investment products, including mutual funds, ETFs and retirement accounts. Fidelity’s expansion into the bitcoin space reflects its longstanding belief that bitcoin is a digital asset set apart from all others. Fidelity Digital Assets, the arm responsible for the FBTC ETF, provides custody and trade execution services for institutional and individual investors interested in bitcoin and other digital assets. Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF Overview The FBTC spot bitcoin ETF seeks to track bitcoin’s price performance as measured by the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate. Unlike derivatives-based products, FBTC is a fully collateralized spot ETF, meaning it holds actual bitcoin in reserve. This makes it a simple and effective option for investors looking to track bitcoin’s value without managing the underlying asset themselves. A key difference between FBTC and other spot bitcoin ETFs is that the bitcoin backing FBTC is held in custody by Fidelity. Most other spot bitcoin ETF providers outsource their custody to Coinbase. Depending on your perspective on custody risk, it may be preferable to know that Fidelity itself holds the bitcoin backing FBTC, rather than the responsibility for the integrity of the fund being diffused across several institutions. Key Features Of The FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF FBTC stands out for its low expense ratio of 0.25%, which is competitive compared to other bitcoin investment vehicles. The ETF’s holdings are fully insured and stored in a mix of cold and hot storage, ensuring both liquidity and security. Additionally, FBTC offers daily liquidity, meaning investors can buy and sell shares as needed, with full transparency regarding the fund’s underlying assets. Benefits of Investing in Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF For investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin in a regulated environment, Fidelity’s FBTC spot bitcoin ETF provides several advantages. Simplified Access To Bitcoin One of the biggest barriers to direct bitcoin investment is the technical complexity involved in purchasing, storing and securing bitcoin. FBTC eliminates these hurdles, allowing investors to buy bitcoin exposure through a familiar brokerage account, just as they would buy any other stock or ETF. Lower Risk Compared To Directly Investing In Bitcoin By holding bitcoin through an ETF, investors trade some of the risks associated with direct bitcoin ownership for others. For example, they trade the risk of being personally responsible for a security breach or losing access to a wallet. On the other hand, they take on counterparty risk, which is the risk that the custodian of the bitcoin that backs the ETF will mismanage or lose access to it. Regulatory Oversight And Security FBTC is subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as other financial products, which provides a level of investor protection not available with direct bitcoin ownership. Additionally, Fidelity Digital Asset Services employs robust security measures, including cold storage for the majority of its bitcoin holdings, ensuring the safety of the underlying assets. Diversification In Traditional Investment Accounts Another benefit of FBTC is that it can be easily incorporated into retirement accounts or other traditional investment portfolios. This allows investors to diversify into bitcoin without disrupting their existing financial strategies. Gain Price Exposure To Bitcoin With Tax Advantaged Accounts One of the key advantages of investing in a spot bitcoin ETF is the ability to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin within tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Disbursing money from a tax-advantaged retirement account to invest in bitcoin would trigger a tax penalty, but simply converting some of the fund’s contents to FBTC provides bitcoin price exposure without the penalty. (If you prefer to hold physical bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account, rather than a spot bitcoin ETF, there are options for that as well.) Risks To Consider Like all investments, Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF carries certain risks that investors should understand. Counterparty Risk A critical risk to consider when investing in a bitcoin ETF, rather than simply holding physical bitcoin itself, is counterparty risk. This refers to the possibility that a party involved in the ETF's operation could default on their obligations. For a bitcoin ETF, a custodian must be responsible for securely storing the bitcoin held by the fund. If the custodian were to experience a security breach or other event that results in the loss of access to the bitcoin in its custody, the fund would fail. While ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight, ensuring these counterparties follow strict protocols, the risk of mismanagement or technical failures still exists. With any asset, there must ultimately be a custodian. If it’s you, you take on risk of loss or mismanagement yourself; if you outsource this responsibility to a custodian, you also take on counterparty risk. Volatility Of Bitcoin Prices Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, and investing in an ETF that tracks its price can expose investors to sharp fluctuations in value. While FBTC offers an easier way to access bitcoin, it does not shield investors from the asset’s inherent volatility. Regulatory Risks As with all cryptocurrency-related products, there is a degree of regulatory uncertainty. Changes in regulations affecting bitcoin or cryptocurrency markets could impact the value of the FBTC ETF. Liquidity And Market Risks Although FBTC is designed to offer daily liquidity, rapid price movements in the bitcoin market could affect the ETF’s ability to trade at its intended value. This could lead to instances where investors buy or sell shares at a premium or discount relative to the ETF’s net asset value (NAV). Potential Management Fees And Costs While FBTC has a competitive fee structure, investors should still be aware of the costs involved, including management fees and potential trading commissions when buying or selling shares. How to Buy Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF Investing in Fidelity’s FBTC Spot Bitcoin ETF is straightforward and can be done through most brokerage accounts. Eligibility And Requirements To invest in FBTC, you need an account with a brokerage that offers access to the Cboe BZX Exchange, where the ETF is listed. Additionally, you must meet any account minimums set by your broker and understand any associated fees. Open A Brokerage Account With Fidelity If you don’t already have an account, you can open a brokerage account with Fidelity or another broker that provides access to the FBTC ETF. The process involves completing an application, funding your account, and agreeing to the brokerage’s terms and conditions. Buy Shares Of FBTC Once your brokerage account is set up, you can place an order to buy shares of FBTC just as you would with any other ETF or stock. Be mindful of the market price and any associated trading fees. Monitor Investment After purchasing shares of FBTC, it’s essential to regularly monitor your investment. Bitcoin’s price volatility means the value of the ETF can fluctuate significantly, so staying informed about market conditions and any relevant news is crucial. FBTC vs. Other Bitcoin Investments For many people, buying and holding bitcoin directly is the best choice. If you are comfortable with digital devices and apps, and want to benefit from bitcoin’s value proposition as an asset and monetary network independent of the legacy financial system, there are plenty of options for exchanging cash for bitcoin and holding it in self custody. People who prefer the familiarity of legacy financial products may find that FBTC offers a more convenient way to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin. FBTC eliminates the need for wallet management and offers a degree of security and oversight. While other bitcoin ETFs, like those based on futures contracts, have their place, FBTC’s spot structure makes it an attractive choice for investors looking for direct exposure to bitcoin’s price performance. Additionally, crypto-focused stocks offer indirect exposure but often include broader company risks, making FBTC a more focused option. FBTC is unique compared to most other spot bitcoin ETFs in that the manager of the fund, Fidelity, is also the custodian of the underlying physical asset. Bottom Line Fidelity’s FBTC spot bitcoin ETF offers a straightforward, regulated, and secure way to invest in bitcoin without directly owning the asset. For investors seeking exposure to bitcoin within a traditional brokerage account, FBTC provides a convenient entry point with lower risks than directly holding the asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is Fidelity's FBTC spot bitcoin ETF available to all investors? Yes, FBTC is available to any investor with access to a brokerage account that supports the Cboe BZX Exchange. What Are The Tax Implications Of Investing In A Bitcoin ETF? Investors are responsible for capital gains taxes when buying or selling shares of FBTC, similar to other investments. How Does The Performance Of FBTC Compare To Actual Bitcoin? FBTC is designed to track bitcoin’s price closely, reflecting its performance with minimal deviation. Can I Hold FBTC In A Retirement Account? Yes, FBTC can be held in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, providing a way to include bitcoin exposure in retirement planning. What Are The Risks Of Investing In Bitcoin ETFs? The primary risks include bitcoin’s price volatility, potential regulatory changes and market liquidity issues. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

                            Ether continues to grow but price levels remain subdued Getty Images When the SEC announced it had approved multiple spot ether ETF products in July 2024 market sentiment was almost universally supportive and encouraged by this action. Following years of stymying efforts by industry advocates and operators to create and trade spot ETFs, the two largest cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – had received ETF approval within the same year. In stark contrast to the dramatic increase in price that bitcoin experienced, the majority of which has remined intact even as headline volatility has continued to increase, the price response to the ether ETF was muted. Even more interestingly the trading volumes and institutional appetite for these ETF products has also remained more lower than the spot bitcoin ETF and/or market forecasts. Highlighting this sluggish beginning are the outflows that have been occurring from the ether ETF products, capped by a nearly $80 million outflow on a single Monday, which was the highest since a $98 million outflow figure in July 2024. While bitcoin has increased over 50% in 2024 (since the launch of spot ETF products), ether has only climbed approximately 15% and has yet to surpass the previous all-time-highs last achieved in 2021. From whichever metric is analyzed the launch of spot ether ETFs has fallen flat when compared to spot bitcoin ETFs. Let’s take a look at a few of the reasons why, despite serving as the blockchain of choice for many Layer 2 applications, the ether ETF has gotten off to a slow start. Bitcoin Is Synonymous With Crypto Even though the cryptoasset space has expanded dramatically in just the last several years, the reality remains that in most media and institutional conversations, bitcoin is still the unquestioned leader. This can be observed either through anecdotally observing business media coverage and corporate announcements, and by watching the actions of TradFi institutions and nation-states alike. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in investment while sending the price of bitcoin up substantially, while corporate purchasers such as Microstrategy continue to focus on exclusively purchasing bitcoin. Larry Fink and Blackrock have issued public facing documents touting the appeal and upside of bitcoin, and nations such as El Salvador and more recently Bhutan have amassed stockpiles of bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape, as well as the dollars that are being allocated by larger institutional investors. Lack Of Narrative As multi-faceted as the crypto landscape continues to be, the narrative and messaging around bitcoin has remained uniquely consistent since inception. From being labeled as digital gold, or a store or value, or the money of the future the narratives around bitcoin have remained steadfast. Even if the specifics of these narratives, or how well they manifest in the market, investors and regulators alike have become familiar with them to base decision making around these frameworks. This consistency has manifested itself even bitcoin is famously decentralized, has no identified creator, nor does the cryptocurrency have any sort of governing body. Read More: Stablecoin Leadership Continues Via A Goldman-Coinbase Exchange Ether on the other hand, has seemingly struggled to find a message and/or narrative that is consistent enough, simple enough, or intuitive enough to be seized by mainstream investors. Even though the Ethereum blockchain and the ether token serves as the base layer for many of the enterprise applications that are driving the investment dollars into crypto, the presentation of Ethereum as the internet of the future or other amorphous value propositions have proven difficult for institutional investors to get behind. Price Paradox Last but certainly not least is the reality that, and directly connected to the primary value proposition of Ethereum and ether at large is the fact that ether is perhaps the token most susceptible to the crypto price paradox. Ether serves as the currency of choice for most of the Layer 2 applications that are driving enterprise adoption; stablecoins, DeFi, DAOs, and even NFTs all (for the most part) run and rely on ether. Even with improvements made via various upgrades – which have substantially increased capacity and reduced cost – the fact remains that pricing services in ether will have exercise downward pressure on a price-per-token basis. Put simply any token, be it ether or otherwise, that simultaneously serves as a potential medium of exchange and investment asset (via spot ETFs), is going to need to obtain a medium satisfactory to both interested parties. Given the muted price action of ether following the approval and launch of spot ether ETFs, and the preference of institutions and governments to select bitcoin above other cryptoassets, and it appears that this paradox will continue to exercise influence for the foreseeable future. Crypto ETFs have been a positive development for the sector, but not all such instruments deliver equally positive returns.

How To Place A Buy Order On eToro Purchasing bitcoin on eToro involves a few steps. After finding bitcoin's profile, you can initiate a buy order by clicking the green "Buy" button; eToro offers different order types to suit various trading strategies and preferences. Choosing The Order Type Market Order: This is the default option for buying bitcoin on eToro. A market order executes immediately at the best available current market price. It's ideal for investors who want to buy bitcoin quickly and aren't concerned about small price fluctuations. Limit Order: With a limit order, you set a specific price at which you're willing to buy bitcoin. The order executes only if bitcoin's price reaches or falls below your set price. This option is useful for investors who have a target entry price and are willing to wait for the market to meet their conditions. Reviewing Investment Amount And Details Before confirming your bitcoin purchase, carefully review the investment details: Investment Amount: Enter the amount you wish to invest in USD, and eToro will display the equivalent amount of bitcoin you'll receive based on the current market price. Remember, you can invest in fractions of bitcoin, allowing for investments as low as $10. Order Type and Price: Confirm whether you're placing a market order at the current price or a limit order at your specified price. For limit orders, ensure your target price is correctly entered. Monitoring Your Bitcoin Investment On eToro After purchasing bitcoin, it's crucial to monitor your investment and implement risk management strategies. eToro provides tools to track your portfolio's performance and make informed decisions about your bitcoin holdings. Reviewing Portfolio Tracking To monitor your bitcoin investment, navigate to the "Portfolio" section on eToro's left sidebar. This page displays all your open positions, including bitcoin. You'll see key information such as the current price, your invested amount and profit/loss in both dollar value and percentage. The portfolio overview at the bottom of the page shows your total invested amount, available cash, and overall portfolio value. For a more detailed view of your bitcoin investment, click on the BTC row in your portfolio. This opens a breakdown of your position, including entry price, current market value, and any applied fees. To help you visualize bitcoin's price movements and market trends, eToro also provides charts and analysis tools. Risk Management Strategies Setting Stop-Loss Orders: One crucial risk management tool is the stop-loss order. This automatically closes your position if bitcoin's price falls to a certain level, limiting potential losses. To set a stop-loss, click on the bitcoin position in your portfolio and select "Edit Trade." Here, you can set your desired stop-loss price. Using Take-Profit Orders: Similarly, take-profit orders allow you to automatically close your position when bitcoin reaches a target price, securing your gains. Set this alongside your stop-loss to define both your risk tolerance and profit goals. Diversification: While bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency, consider diversifying your portfolio. The eToro platform offers various other cryptocurrencies, stocks and ETFs. Spreading your investments can help mitigate risk associated with bitcoin's volatility. Stay Informed: Regularly check eToro's news feed and analysis section for updates on bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Being aware of market trends, regulatory changes, and technological developments can help you make informed decisions about your investment. Bottom Line Buying bitcoin on eToro offers a user-friendly approach to cryptocurrency investment. The platform simplifies the process with straightforward account creation, various funding options and an intuitive interface for purchasing and managing bitcoin. Social trading features and educational resources on eToro provide additional support for both novice and experienced investors. Remember to approach bitcoin investment with caution. Utilize eToro's risk management tools, stay informed about market trends and only invest what you can afford to lose. As with any investment, diversification and regular portfolio review are key to maintaining a balanced approach in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                            The stock market ended last week on a high note, wrapping up the quarter with a sense of optimism. This positive momentum is largely fueled by expectations that the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut will boost economic activity and set the stage for a stronger performance in the new quarter. With the presidential election approaching in November, investors are increasingly focused on how the political landscape may influence market movements. With these factors in play, let’s explore what this week has in store for investors and how the market may respond. A few earnings to watch On Monday, Carnival Corporation (CCL) will kick off the week by reporting its earnings before the market opens. On Tuesday, all eyes will be on apparel giant Nike (NKE), which has been grappling with sluggish sales, as it releases earnings after the market closes. And on Wednesday, Levi Strauss & Co. will reveal its quarterly financial performance following the closing bell, providing further insight into the apparel industry’s health. Crypto event in New York: Mainnet 2024 Messari, a leading provider of market intelligence for the crypto and Web3 sectors, is set to host its annual Mainnet conference in New York City from September 30 to October 2. This three-day event will bring together prominent crypto leaders, investors, and industry professionals for a series of networking opportunities, collaborative sessions, and in-depth programming. This year’s conference will spotlight key topics shaping the future of the digital asset space. Among the highlights will be discussions on crypto’s evolving role in today’s investment portfolios and its broader economic impact. Additionally, the event will explore the growing trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and the integration of traditional financial instruments on blockchain, signaling a shift towards more mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. Other macroeconomic data to watch On Tuesday, U.S. auto sales data for September will be released, offering insights into whether consumer demand for vehicles is rebounding or if buyers remain cautious amid economic uncertainties. In the labor market, the week will bring a series of significant updates. On Wednesday, ADP (ADP) will release its private sector employment report, providing an early snapshot of job growth. This will be followed on Thursday by the weekly initial jobless claims, offering a glimpse into trends in layoffs. Finally, on Friday, the U.S. employment report will be released, including key metrics such as the unemployment rate and changes in hourly wages, which will help gauge the overall health of the labor market.

                    Why Trump's crypto scheme could be his shadiest grift yet

                            While it has been a treat to see the value of shares in Trump Media drop off a cliff, what is much less fun is thinking about how much the whole enterprise distorts democracy. Before Trump, it would have been impossible to imagine a former president helming a publicly traded company while running for office again. However, the Trump presidency shattered every norm as Trump used his office to line his pockets. A second Trump presidency will be worse, without a doubt, particularly because the federal courts, now stuffed with Trump appointees, are happily weakening the meager guardrails that remain. While the name “Trump Media” connotes some sort of multi-faceted media empire, it’s really just Truth Social, Trump’s hard-right social media network. Truth Social is, to put it bluntly, not terribly popular. Its audience keeps plummeting, and even Trump has returned to posting on X, a rival platform with an audience nearly 100 times that of Truth Social. The stock was comically overvalued, pegged at $7 billion despite Truth Social posting millions of dollars of losses and having nearly no revenue. None of that seems to matter to die-hard Trump fans, who poured money into the stock with what one stock analyst called a “quasi-religious fervor.” They’re happy to excuse the losses, making statements like “I did it more as a statement to President Trump and to show support at the time,” said Teri Lynn Roberson to ABC News. “I wasn't really looking to make a lot of money,” said Roberson, who bought five shares of the company after it went public in March. That’s probably the best attitude, given that top executives at Trump Media started selling off their shares as soon as possible, eating huge losses in their quest to get out from under the failing stock. Trump still owns his shares, representing roughly 57% of the company. Until Sept. 19, Trump could not sell shares, as he and other company insiders were in a six-month lock-up period. Toward the end of the lock-up period, Trump said he wouldn’t be selling his shares, a statement that goosed the stock price a bit at the time. In a typical company, this might be seen as a vote of confidence from the founder, a willingness to risk their own fortunes. But Trump has far darker reasons to hold on to his stock. If Trump wins the election, the chances that investors will pony up and buy Trump Media stock increases. People could buy access to the president by throwing money at his company, which he would be running from the White House. As Abdallah Fayyad explained at Vox, it is easy to imagine someone who has maxed out their campaign contributions deciding to show support for Trump by investing in Trump Media instead. This is, of course, not speculation. During Trump’s first term, millions of dollars poured into his hotel in Washington, D.C., with Republicans pretending that they were just staying there because it was the most convenient location. However, they’ve barely stayed in that hotel since it changed hands and became a Waldorf Astoria in 2022. And why would they? It’s no longer a way to show Trump their support by helping him profit financially. Trump has shifted his focus as well, instead selling access to Mar-a-Lago to the tune of $1 million per membership. Trump Media is an ethical nightmare, but at least it’s a publicly traded company, which comes with transparency and oversight. Trump’s push into the crypto market, on the other hand, is opaque and unregulated—the perfect vehicle for a corrupt former president to get spectacularly more corrupt if he’s elected again. The crypto project, with the uninspired name of World Liberty Financial, serves as a way for Trump to give all his failsons—now including Barron, who is the “visionary” behind the project—a fake job that still comes with real money. The fact that all of Trump’s adult sons—none of whom have worked in the financial sector—are heading the project is one way to tell that this crypto effort will just be another unserious grift. Additionally, no one seems to actually know what this crypto company will do, even after a two-hour livestream launching the effort. Even Trump doesn’t seem quite sure. When trying to explain it, here’s what he came up with: “Crypto is one of those things we have to do… Whether we like it or not, I have to do it… It's crypto, it's AI, it's some of the other things,” he said in an interview on X. Got it. Where some of Trump’s other ventures, like Trump steaks, Trump bottled water, and Trump vodka, might have appealed to the masses if they were any good, Trump’s relatively newfound affinity for crypto is wholly tied to that financial sector’s affinity for right-wing politics. It’s also a way for him to court the crypto vote and contrast himself with the Biden-Harris administration, which has cracked down on crypto scams and prosecuted people like Sam Bankman-Fried for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. The crypto sector has spent over $100 million during the 2024 election cycle thus far, hoping to usher in an era of less oversight and fewer consumer protections. Trump is the superior political choice if you want less regulation of the financial markets. The conservatives on the Supreme Court have already seriously dented the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to address violations by ruling that they must conduct full-fledged jury trials rather than use an in-house administrative process. Those same conservatives also just struck down the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes. Under Biden, the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has called the crypto sector “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters.” If Trump wins in 2024, he could weaken the SEC without legislation or court action simply by installing people who won’t impose fines or pursue scammy crypto companies. That’s not just a giveaway to the crypto bros Trump is courting, though. It would also be a move that lines Trump’s pockets with unregulated crypto cash while in the White House. Ordinary people can see the obvious problems here. Trump shouldn’t have private business interests while in the White House, period, but all of that went out the window in his first administration. Trump certainly shouldn’t have a private business in a regulated industry like securities when he would have the power to weaken regulations over his own business. But Trump fans love giving Trump’s businesses money and increasing his personal bottom line. They understand very well that Trump looks favorably at their efforts to funnel him cash. If he wins in November and his nonsense crypto project stays afloat until he takes office in 2025, conservatives—and hucksters and grifters—will have a very easy way to buy off the president with no fear of oversight. The only way to stop this is to ensure Trump doesn’t win. Of course, he’ll still continue to hawk whatever products will help him fleece his supporters, but at least he won’t be able to do it from the Oval Office.
