                    Nigerian Gov Sues Traders Over Unlicensed Stablecoin USDT Naira Trades

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images NurPhoto via Getty Images Earlier this month, the Federal Government of Nigeria filed a criminal lawsuit against four Nigerian crypto traders—Ejiogu A. Chinedu, Nnamdi F. Okereke, Oty Ugochukwu Stanley, and Chukwuebuka F. Ogumba—and some firms for conducting business, including USDT and Naira trades, effectively as financial institutions without a valid banking license. As per the fillings, as exclusively obtained and reported by Nairametrics, the government believes that the charged defendants, through their business transactions, have violated the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act of 2020 and are seeking the Federal High Court in Abuja—the nation's capital—to dispense the appropriate punishment. Brief Background This court case is off the heels of the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) investigation into alleged activities via several bank accounts of individuals using digital assets exchanges to manipulate the Naira's value and launder proceeds from these activities. The EFCC filed a motion to freeze the identified accounts pending the conclusion of their investigation. The court later granted an interim order that saw over 1,00 accounts listed in the commission's motion on April 24 frozen for over ninety days. These accounts held over N548.6 million, or roughly over $330,000 as of writing. The charged parties were able to get their request to lift several freezing orders granted by the court. However, that was short-lived, as the commission filed a new motion to freeze these accounts until the conclusion of their investigation, which the court granted on September 4, after they had also separately filed criminal charges against the alleged operators of the accounts in question.

Additionally, according to filings from the government in June and July, the defendants stand accused by the Nigerian government of engaging in business activities without a valid license all the way back from 2021 to January 2024. Nevertheless, this is an ongoing court case, with legal teams from both sides making their case, accordingly. It remains unclear what the duration of this case will be, but it is safe to say we can expect it to go on for quite a while before the High Court makes a final decision. Consequences Of This Lawsuit The Nigerian government’s lawsuit could set a chilling precedent for those providing P2P OTC services to be considered requiring a banking license to facilitate USDT and Naira trades or be deemed engaging in illicit activities with the judgment of this case—should the defendants be found guilty—serving as the base penalty. Further, with Nigeria ranking as one of the top adopters and users of both USDT and Bitcoin according to data from Chainalysis, it'll no doubt further exacerbate the operating climate for digital assets businesses. Nigerian Government Sentiment On Bitcoin & Stablecoins These developments are no surprise for those following the regulatory landscape in Nigeria. On the one hand, the Nigerian government is attempting to balance doing all it can to defend the Naira as it continues to plunge against the US Dollar and protect consumers and investors, and on the other hand trying to create an enabling environment for the digital assets space to thrive. However, until and unless there is a distinction between Bitcoin and the more wider space, we are likely to see more of these sorts of developments unfold. We will have to wait and see how this lawsuit and other developments in the regulatory environment progress. Suffice it to say, it is not all doom and gloom. Now is the time for relevant stakeholders to constructively engage regulators to come to a more favorable position for all parties, government inclusive. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                            The people behind World Liberty Financial — former President Donald Trump, his sons, and his business associates — have made a lot of promises about the cryptocurrency platform’s revolutionary potential. It will liberate “the average American” from “the big banks and financial elites,” Trump posted on Truth Social. It will help unbanked and debanked people, Donald Trump Jr. said in an X Space. What no one involved with the project has said is how this will happen or what, exactly, World Liberty Financial does. Now, the mystery service is accepting signups — but not from everyone. Despite scant details about World Liberty Financial, its whitelists are now open, the company announced on X and Truth Social on Monday. The platform is now letting US-based accredited investors and non-US persons begin the know-your-customer (KYC) verification process. It’s worth reiterating: neither Trump nor anyone else involved in World Liberty Financial has given an in-depth explanation of what service the platform actually provides. Here’s what we do know: World Liberty Financial has said its goal is to drive “mass adoption of stable coins and decentralized finance.” Near the end of a two-hour-plus X Space announcing the project, World Liberty Financial adviser Corey Caplan said it would “sell and otherwise distribute governance tokens called WLFI.” CoinDesk previously reported that World Liberty Financial would be built on the Ethereum blockchain and Aave, a decentralized finance platform, and would center around a “credit account system.” CoinDesk also obtained a whitepaper about the project, which said that 70 percent of WLFI would be held by World Liberty Financial’s founding members, team, and service providers. But during the stream announcing the platform, Caplan said the “fake news media” got the details wrong and that 63 percent of tokens would be sold to the public. “Additional information about World Liberty Financial is only intended to be available to persons who have been pre-qualified by completing a KYC process,” World Liberty Financial’s website states. In a post on X, World Liberty Financial blamed “outdated policy and regulations in the US” that limited whitelists to accredited investors and non-US persons. [Media: https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1840776609164407284] The Securities and Exchange Commission defines accredited investors as individuals with net worths of at least $1 million — excluding the value of their primary residence — either individually or with their spouse or partner. Their annual income must be at least $200,000 individually or $300,000 with a spouse or partner for at least the past two years. There are other requirements for professionals and business entities. As of 2022, more than 24 million American households qualified as accredited investors, according to the SEC’s estimates. That’s a not insignificant amount of Americans — nearly 20 percent of households in the US, a number that’s attributed partly to recent inflation. But it’s still a far cry from the unbanked and underserved communities Trump and his sons claimed World Liberty Financial is supposed to help. And, to reiterate one final time: we still don’t know what it does.

The APEC Summit takes place through November 17. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Getty Images China's economic growth is slowing significantly. This year, it may fail to achieve what was already a low 5% annual growth rate goal. Beyond representing a significant economic change, this will have many implications for Bitcoin. It may well represent a hidden bullish factor as Bitcoin prices continue to test upward momentum after a couple of months of stagnation—a theme I often explore in my book on Bitcoin + China. 1- China's investors are looking for an exit from stagnating Chinese assets Asset bubbles are being created in China, which has been responsible for the stark increase in gold prices. Since Chinese equities and real estate are down, there's a premium for exiting money from the Chinese system and getting a return elsewhere. Chinese investors have piled onto gold ETFs and government bonds. In 2022, Chinese savers were estimated to sock away over $2.6 trillion in the domestic Chinese banking sector. However, that behavior may change with interest rates now ticking down and more stimulus being put on the table. A persistently high Chinese savings rate unique among other nations may need a new place to go: with historic interest in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies, Chinese investors looking for an exit ramp may just choose Bitcoin's allure - a path towards getting money out of the Chinese system and being able to transact with financial freedom. With an exchange ban in the Mainland, over-the-trading counters are one way for Chinese people to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. While some Chinese crypto buyers use exchanges with different addresses, many large buyers would prefer to work with OTC desks. Those OTC desks have recently seen record inflows since 2021, showing a rebound from when China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining and trading. This recent surge in price-boosting demand seems motivated mainly by the declining return on Chinese assets. 2- China's central bank is piling more onto the stimulus fire in response China's economic downturn has created pressure on both monetary and fiscal authorities to turn the economy around. The most alarming statistic is the high unemployment rate for youth. The central bank is decreasing interest rate targeting and loosening the money supply in China, which will help in the short term with Bitcoin's correlation with risk assets as central banks race with one another to fight growing downturns in the economy around the world. Already, Chinese investors are racing back from bonds to Chinese equities - risk assets more correlated with Bitcoin's price. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is also lowering rates and expanding US monetary supply, which will allow the Chinese central bank to also lower rates to keep the Yuan at the same preferred trading range as now and not to worry about a weakening Yuan against the US dollar (in fact, both may just weaken against Bitcoin.) 3- Chinese businesses are still a large part of Bitcoin's network In the case of Bitcoin mining, it's estimated that about 20% of the global hash rate still resides in China despite increasing amounts of restrictions and province-level bans as of 2022. As local governments in China struggle to raise tax revenue because of declining land value, the prospect of working with companies that can leverage stranded power into tax revenue and economic growth becomes much more attractive - and may account for the surprising amount of global hash rate securing the Bitcoin network remaining in China despite the level of restrictions and bans.

Though tariffs have hit them on the American side and restrictions on the Chinese side, and now they manufacture mostly outside of China, they still maintain many offices in China. Many mining pools offering software that coordinates Bitcoin mining originated from China, and exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX did, too. As an economic downturn with few state-guided technological windfalls unwinds, the entrepreneurial energy dedicated to starting Bitcoin's momentum in China may now be directed towards Bitcoin again, along with increases in buying activity. Chinese entrepreneurs, businesses, and buyers will once again have the opportunity to contribute their efforts to Bitcoin - as I've written at length about in my book on Bitcoin + China. China's loss, in this case, may well be Bitcoin's gain. Check out my website. Roger Huang Following Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades

                            Former President Donald Trump announced his new crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) on Monday, with limited signups open to accredited investors in the United States as well as other investors who meet the eligibility criteria in the rest of the world. But despite the passion that crypto projects and Trump often inspire in their online boosters, Trump’s latest branding foray is raising eyebrows even among the diehards. “This will be the biggest scam in all of defi” posted a user with a long string of memecoins in their bio. “I’m going to go out on a limb here and say – this will be a net negative to crypto,” wrote another. DeFi” is “decentralized finance,” which in crypto refers to blockchain platforms where people can cut out the middlemen of bankers, brokerages, and exchanges and trade crypto directly with each other. WLFI purports to be a “cutting-edge” platform in the space. In a tweet promoting the launch, Trump wrote that its goal is to “help make America the crypto capital of the world!” Other posters lamented the fact that Trump was probably going to use the platform to launch a new coin instead of leaning into the current relative popularity of Bitcoin. “Study Bitcoin. Stop promoting weird money-grab scams. Do better. Be better,” wrote @gaborgurbacs. “Don’t shitcoin, it’s bad for you,” wrote one. “Bitcoiners, this still yer guy?” asked another, referring to Trump’s recent appearance at a Bitcoin conference. Many crypto posters, who are often attracted to the space because of the pseudonymity it allows, as well as a lack of regulation, are balking at the comparatively stringent steps to be eligible for the platform’s whitelist. “So to continue after verifying your identity, there is an Accredited Investor Verification Method and to pass as an individual, you have to make more than $100k a year,” posted @FreakFls. “I thought this was for everyone.” “Was excited for this, but can’t even be a part of it as an American,” posted @Nate_Apes. WLFI explained in a string of posts announcing its launch that “outdated policies and regulations in the US” are responsible for limiting the platform to accredited U.S. investors and “non-US persons.” “We’re fighting for changes so all Americans can access World Liberty Financial and join the financial revolution,” it added. WLFI didn’t immediately respond to questions asking what policies or regulations blocked non-accredited American investors from joining. “If a platform requires you to KYC, it is not DeFi,” criticized another backer. While Trump once warned that crypto was “potentially a disaster waiting to happen,” he’s since pivoted and embraced the technology whole-heartedly. One reason for that might be his youngest son Barron’s interest in cryptocurrency. In a Twitter Space earlier in September where Trump discussed launching a crypto platform, he effused about Barron’s knowledge about crypto, boasting that he “knows this stuff inside and out.” Outside of lowbie meme-coin boosting accounts, bigger players in the nexus between cryptocurrency and politics have also raised doubts about the wisdom of Trump getting involved in the space. “Is there something that we, as crypto twitter, can collectively do to stop the launch of world liberty coin?” crypto influencer Nic Carter posted at the beginning of September. “I think it genuinely damages trump’s electoral prospects, especially if it gets hacked (it’ll be the juiciest DeFi target ever and it’s forked from a protocol that itself was hacked).” “It’s also an obvious target for the SEC,” Carter explained. “At best it’s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it’s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble. So are we signing a petition or what?” Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email. Sign up for the Daily Dot’s web_crawlr newsletter here.

                    10 Mind-Blowing Things I Learned At Token 2049 Week About Web3 And AI

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Live at Token 2049 Week in Singapore Sandy Carter Wow, what a whirlwind Token 2049 was! As I came out of the events, my head spinning with new ideas (and maybe from a few too many after-parties), I realized I'd witnessed some truly game-changing stuff. Here are the 10 most mind-blowing things I learned, with all the details: Singapore is Crypto's Disneyland Token 2049 transformed Singapore into a crypto wonderland. With over 20,000 attendees and 800 side events, it felt like the whole city had caught the blockchain bug. I half-expected to see the Merlion sporting laser eyes! Walking down Orchard Road, I saw crypto logos plastered on everything from billboards to coffee cups. The Marina Bay Sands, usually a beacon of traditional tourists, was overrun with blockchain enthusiasts sporting their favorite project's merch. Even taxi drivers were chatting about the latest DeFi protocols. It was surreal to see a whole city embrace crypto culture so wholeheartedly, even if just for a week. This level of mainstream exposure is exactly what the industry needs to push towards mass adoption. I’d love to see anything like this level of enthusiasm at the next major European or North American crypto event.

Asia is where it's at for Web3 and blockchain. The energy was electric, with companies like Bitget (boasting 43 million users!), OKX, and Binance leading the charge. It's clear that to stay ahead in crypto, we need to keep our eyes on the East. BitGet at the SheFi Event at Token 2049 Week Sandy Carter What struck me most was the sheer scale of adoption. In a panel discussion, I learned that Asian crypto exchanges are processing volumes that dwarf their Western counterparts. The regulatory environment in countries like Singapore and Japan is fostering innovation while providing necessary guardrails. It's not just about trading either – Asian countries are pioneering real-world blockchain applications, from supply chain management in South Korea to digital identity solutions in Taiwan. The East-West knowledge exchange at Token 2049 was eye-opening, and it's clear that anyone serious about crypto needs to have a strong Asian strategy. Real-World Assets are Going Digital RWA tokenization was the talk of the town. I was on a panel at the Orbis86 event with Hedera Hedera , XDC XDC Network , and CoinRepublic talking about the opportunities and where we still need to uplevel to be truly successful. Real World Asset (RWA) Panel at Token 2049 Week Orbis86 I met with companies like Diamore, who are turning diamond authenticity into RWAs. Maker Maker , Centrifuge, and PropyKeys are making it possible to tokenize everything from real estate to fine art. It's democratizing investment in a way I never thought possible. I attended a workshop where Centrifuge demonstrated how they're tokenizing invoices to provide liquidity to small businesses. The potential impact on global finance is staggering. Imagine being able to own a fraction of a Picasso or invest in a commercial real estate project halfway across the world with just a few clicks. The regulatory challenges are significant, but the enthusiasm and progress I saw at Token 2049 make me believe that RWA tokenization will be a major force in bridging traditional finance with the crypto world. DePIN is the New Internet Backbone Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are set to disrupt big tech. Helium Helium , Silencio, and Akash Network are leading the charge, offering decentralized alternatives for wireless networks, noise, storage, and computing. I was skeptical at first, but seeing a live demo of Helium's decentralized 5G network made me a believer. The idea that we could collectively own and operate the infrastructure that powers our digital lives is revolutionary. Filecoin's Filecoin presentation on their decentralized storage solution made me rethink everything I thought I knew about cloud computing. These projects are not just creating alternatives to big tech; they're reimagining the very foundation of the internet. Breakpoint by Solana Solana Rocked My World Solana is redefining blockchain accessibility. Seeing giants like Google Cloud and Franklin Templeton jump on board was eye-opening. The Solana Foundation, Jupiter Jupiter , and Pyth Network are making waves. I attended a hackathon where developers were building complex DApps on Solana in hours, not days. The speed and low cost of transactions on Solana are enabling use cases that simply weren't feasible just a few months ago. Solana's Breakpoint 2024 Sandy Carter A panel discussion with Solana's core developers revealed ambitious plans for further scaling and security enhancements. It's clear that Solana has learned from its past challenges and is positioning itself as a serious contender for mainstream blockchain adoption. Blockchain Gaming Leveled Up The gaming scene at Token 2049 was mind-blowing, with Telegram emerging as an unexpected gaming platform. Companies like Gamee and TON Toncoin Play are changing the game, literally. Telegram is making its app more exciting by adding games alongside its messaging features. This mix of chatting and playing keeps users entertained and using the app for longer periods. I tried out a few blockchain games that were indistinguishable from traditional mobile games in terms of graphics and gameplay, but with the added benefit of true ownership of in-game assets. The integration with Telegram is genius, leveraging an existing user base of millions. I was on a panel about the future of onchain gaming, having just launched .LFG with the former President of Gala Games Jason Brink (note: I work for Unstoppable Domains). It was predicted that within five years, most gamers will be earning crypto without even realizing it. The line between gaming and finance is blurring, and it's exciting to think about the possibilities. AI and Blockchain are a Power Couple The fusion of AI and blockchain is creating incredible possibilities. Ocean Protocol, SingularityNET, and Fetch.ai showcased how this combo could revolutionize everything from data markets to autonomous agents. I watched a demo where an AI model was trained on decentralized data sources, with every step recorded on a blockchain for transparency. The potential for creating more ethical and efficient AI systems is enormous. In our AI and Blockchain panel at the Smobler event, it was interesting discussing with my colleagues from AWS, PWC Invesco Dynamic Market ETF , and Republic on this inevitable match of AI and Blockchain. The AI and Blockchain panel at NOVA, a Smobler event Smobler Another presentation explored how blockchain could create a marketplace for AI services, enabling anyone to monetize their algorithms. I even created a meme coin on the spot with AI and blockchain from Kava Kava . It's early days, but the synergy between these two transformative technologies could lead to innovations we can't even imagine yet. Cross-Chain is the Future Interoperability is the name of the game. Polkadot Polkadot , Cosmos, and LayerZero LayerZero are making it easier for different blockchains to talk to each other. It's like watching the internet of blockchains being built in real-time. I participated in a workshop where we transferred assets between three different blockchains in minutes, with minimal fees. The implications for DeFi and beyond are staggering. A world where liquidity can flow freely between any blockchain ecosystem will unlock tremendous value. However, it also raises important questions about security and standardization that the community is actively working to address. Privacy is Paramount With so much value locked in blockchain networks, privacy and security are taking center stage. Oasis Network, Aztec Protocol, and Mina Protocol are developing cutting-edge solutions to keep our digital assets safe. I attended a fascinating debate on the balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. The zero-knowledge proof demonstrations were mind-bending – the ability to prove you know something without revealing what you know has applications far beyond crypto. As mainstream adoption grows, these privacy solutions will be crucial in protecting users and building trust in the ecosystem. DAOs are Evolving Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are evolving beyond simple voting mechanisms. MakerDAO, Aragon, and Snapshot are pioneering new governance models that could reshape how we think about corporate structure. I participated in a DAO simulation workshop that showed how complex decisions could be made efficiently in a decentralized manner. The potential for DAOs to disrupt traditional organizational structures is immense. From managing global workforces to governing entire protocols, DAOs are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in organizational design. However, challenges around legal recognition and scalability remain, providing fertile ground for further innovation. My Lasting Experiences As I left Token 2049, one thing was clear: the Web3 and Blockchain revolution is just getting started, and the convergence with AI is adding rocket fuel to the mix. These innovations aren't just changing crypto; they're set to transform how we interact with technology, finance, and each other. The convergence of so many brilliant minds and groundbreaking ideas in one place was truly inspiring. It's exciting to think about how these trends will develop and intersect in the coming years. I can't wait to see what next year's event will bring. Maybe blockchain-powered teleportation? Given the pace of innovation I witnessed at Token 2049, it wouldn't surprise me. In this wild world of Web3, anything seems possible. One thing's for sure – I'll be clearing my calendar for the next Token 2049 Week, ready to have my mind blown all over again.

                    Donald and Eric Trump reveal their plan for an American (financial) revolution — with a crypto launch
                </h3>

                            After more than a year of speculation, Donald Trump announced Monday enrollment for World Liberty Financial — his family company’s entry into the cryptocurrency world — has finally begun. And it’s a family affair, with youngest son Barron even having a role. “I promised to Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” the former president tweeted. The enterprise aims to “help make America the crypto capital of the world! The whitelist for eligible persons is officially open — this is your chance to be part of this historic moment.” Trump placed his assets in the company he spent a lifetime building in a trust when he entered the White House in 2017 and handed over the firm’s day-to-day management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric.Ahead of the launch, Eric Trump exclusively spoke with The Post and explained WLF’s mission: to offer Americans an alternative to “big” banks and “traditional” lenders. “Nobody knows better than myself and my family how complicated, corrupt and biased today’s banking systems are,” said the 40-year-old Trump Organization executive vice president. “The system isn’t working. If it doesn’t work for us then it damn sure isn’t working for folks with a few less zeroes in their accounts. We’ve gotta solve that.” The Trumps’ proposed solution is the decentralized-finance (DeFi) firm WLF — tagline: “Be DeFiant” — and their goal is simple but ambitious: make it as easy for people to get a loan as it is to send a text. “We came to realize: Why? Why can’t someone just write this into a simple program that makes it easy for regular people to access financial markets and healthy debt without all these fees and middlemen? Why? There’s absolutely no reason anymore,” Trump said. “This is not just bitcoin. It’s about making the financial markets a truly decentralized, truly equitable exchange for the very first time.” To do this, Trump said WLF will democratize banking by leveraging what the blockchain does best: distributing the digital ownership of physical value. “WLF will not be an exchange” like Binance or Coinbase, WLF co-founder Zak Folkman told The Post. “It is a governance platform that will allow permissionless and peer-to-peer borrowing and lending of digital assets.” This means if someone needs money to redo their kitchen or start a business, they can be vetted, verified and funded with real cash in minutes instead of months. “WLF’s platform is designed with simplicity, making it easy for blockchain newcomers to navigate DeFi confidently. Our goal is to make it as simple to use DeFi as it is to use apps from the App Store,” Folkman said. Trump said his company worked with “serious experts” and “true geniuses” like Folkman to get WLF ready for launch. Crypto and DeFi are sleeping political giants that finally began to stir in 2024. So far, the industries have donated more than $190 million to political candidates on both sides of the aisle this cycle — but with a new slant towards pro-business Republicans that’s raising eyebrows on the left. That’s up from just $60 million in 2020. The new kids on the blockchain seem ready to take a bigger step towards the spotlight — and the Trumps couldn’t be happier to help. Eric Trump told The Post today’s banks are “sluggish” and “will almost certainly be replaced by DeFi” in the next 25 years. His father was once skeptical about the new technology, but he’s come around and then some: The former prez vowed to make America “the crypto capital of the planet” when he spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in July. Donald Trump courted crypto voters at the industry’s biggest event while Vice President Kamala Harris was nowhere to be found — though she’s said she plans to learn more about the topic. “There’s no reason everyday people should be paying for a bank president’s third beach house,” Eric said. “People are getting crushed by these middlemen and rich manipulators. But if someone has, say, 30 bitcoin, why should anyone be able to stop her from borrowing against that? Well, soon they won’t be able to. Then we’ll see who gets crushed.” WLF’s senior leadership team is also now official and includes Donald Trump, Eric Trump, Folkman, Donald Trump Jr., Chase Herron, real-estate wiz Steve Witkoff — and the former president’s youngest child, Barron Trump. Eric Trump told The Post he couldn’t wait for the coming launch. “This is a chance to cancel those big institutions that tried to cancel us,” he said. “You don’t have to be a member of my family to know what that feels like. I think we’re all ready for some liberty.”

As of July 2024, over $2.2 billion has been raised across 24 funds, according to data from PitchBook, putting the market on track to surpass last year’s $2.6 billion total. “We've seen an upward trend quarter over quarter for the last three,” says Robert Le, a senior analyst at PitchBook. “I still think we're somewhat in a capital-constrained environment. Typically, venture investments in crypto follow the performance of publicly traded tokens. In March of this year, the market recovered to 93% of its previous cycle’s peak in total market cap. However, we’re still far from seeing the same level of venture capital investment as before, particularly the $30 billion raised in the last cycle. Many investors felt burned by the failures and losses in that period, so they’re much more cautious about deploying capital now." Crypto venture fundraising peaked in 2022 before a major collapse in 2023. Pitchbook Macroeconomic challenges such as inflation and rising interest rates have curbed investments in riskier assets like crypto. But, according to Banafsheh Fathieh, co-founder and general partner at Lightspeed Faction (Faction collaborates with Lightspeed Venture Partners Faction, but operates its $285 million fund independently), the crypto industry has undergone a necessary correction. With the excesses of the last bull run behind them, investors are returning, albeit cautiously. Fathieh highlights that early-stage investments—now accounting for roughly 80% of activity—are seeing renewed interest. The exuberance of 2021, she adds, created market distortions, but the current environment reflects a healthier and more deliberate approach to growth and innovation. Key Narratives As the market recalibrates, investors are eyeing specific sectors poised for growth. Infrastructure, particularly within the Solana ecosystem, is seeing renewed interest. "Solana is taking market share from Ethereum and others,” says Matthew Graham, founder and managing partner at Ryze Labs (formerly Sino Global Capital). "We’re going to see more consumer-facing apps with real product-market fit emerge, and Solana’s technology is well-positioned to support that shift." Graham emphasizes the potential in consumer applications that fuse gaming with practical utility, citing examples like fitness apps such as STEPN. However, he warns that investors be mindful of the source of revenues. Whether returns are generated through tokens, equity, or hybrid models, understanding the nuances of these financial structures is critical for long-term success. Venture capitalists are also excited about DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) that coordinate machines and devices like Helium, a blockchain-based wireless network; Hivemapper, a decentralized mapping network that aggregates road-level imagery and data; and GEODNET, a blockchain-based project focused on improving location data accuracy. “All of those guys have started to show some ability to go to market on demand. We need to see that continue to grow,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly Capital. The potential of decentralized AI is also drawing attention. While some speculate on decentralized networks replacing cloud giants like AWS or Azure, Fanizadeh is more cautious: “To be candid, I don't think that will happen, but there are a few places where crypto is not an optional piece of technology but a critical piece.” AI developers often cite access to computing power as their primary hurdle. Fanizadeh points to innovations like decentralized GPU marketplaces, which allow idle computing resources to be pooled for AI workloads (one example is Lightspeed Faction’s portfolio company Hyperbolic Labs). Another area “where crypto becomes quite interesting is where cryptography enables a verification layer where it can ensure things like data integrity, model integrity. That can create sort of a verification and authentication mechanism for everything that really feeds in into AI” (Faction’s verification-focused plays include Nexus and Space and Time). Rethinking Late-Stage Investments Late-stage investments, which saw inflated valuations during the last bull run, have been subject to greater scrutiny. “There’s been a recommitment to being more thoughtful about how much and at what price to put capital into,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “While seed-stage valuations have remained somewhat elevated, later-stage unicorns have traded at steep discounts. For non-token equity businesses, we’re seeing 60% discounts, maybe even lower, depending on the company. We've seen Chainalysis [blockchain intelligence firm], Fireblocks [custodian and blockchain infrastructure provider] trade at 70% discounts. For some, like OpenSea [an NFT marketplace, threatened to be sued by the SEC], there’s something like a 90% discount.” Despite these markdowns, Fanizadeh believes that quality companies will rebound as the economic environment shifts. “Even if you have a contraction on the multiple side, if they are good businesses—and many of them are—they’ll have some time to recover,” she says. “As the interest rate environment changes, you’ll start to see the equity side return to more normalized multiples.” In the meantime, investors are focusing more heavily on seed-stage opportunities, where the potential for growth—and risk—is more palpable. What’s Next? PitchBook’s Le predicts an influx of first-time fund managers. "Over the next year or two, we’re going to see many of these new funds come to market, marking a new cycle of innovation," he says. The emphasis will be on sustainable, long-term growth rather than short-term hype. The cyclical nature of the crypto market, as tracked by PitchBook, often mirrors bitcoin’s halving events, which cut the rewards for mining bitcoin by half. Historically, peaks in crypto fundraising have aligned with these cycles, with notable surges in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Writes Le “If these historical trends continue, we anticipate another fundraising peak in 2026, aligning with the next expected major cycle in the crypto market.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                    Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck with crypto voters, Coinbase poll says

                            American cryptocurrency owners are equally divided over whether they prefer Kamala Harris or Donald Trump to take office next year, according to a new Morning Consult poll conducted for the crypto exchange Coinbase. Cryptocurrency has become a pivotal issue in this year’s U.S. presidential election. Former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has positioned himself as a “crypto candidate,” while Democratic candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris has voiced her support for the crypto and blockchain industry. This shift in the political landscape is a stark contrast to just a few years ago when both major parties were skeptical about the future of cryptocurrency. The result of the changing perceptions is a dead-even split among crypto enthusiasts. The report’s polling indicated that an equal 47% of crypto owners intend to vote for Harris, while 47% say they’ll vote for Trump. A significant increase in crypto owners The Coinbase (COIN) report revealed that 52 million Americans own cryptocurrency in 2023, which is seven times more than the national vote differential in the 2020 presidential election. Additionally, cryptocurrency owners are concentrated in swing states, which will be crucial for either candidate’s victory in the November election. “When we look at ownership by state, around 6.5 million crypto owners live in the seven battleground states,” the report says. “That’s more than 16 times the vote differential combined in these states in the 2020 presidential election.” Seventy-six percent of crypto owners living in America say they own cryptocurrency because it gives them a sense of freedom, and nearly 87% believe that the current financial system needs an update, according to the report. Additionally, 74% of crypto owners want Congress to pass a clearer crypto regulations bill. Diversity among crypto owners The report highlights that crypto owners are significantly more diverse than the general U.S. adult population. Notably, 68% of crypto owners are Gen Z or millennials, 48% identify as non-White, and 70% earn less than $100,000 annually. According to the report, they will vote for a crypto-friendly candidate in November. The report points out that the data contradicts the common perception that most crypto owners are Republican or libertarian. “They are a bipartisan group in terms of political identification and electoral intention,” the report says. “They are just as likely to vote for Kamala Harris as they are Donald Trump.”

                    Legal Status Of Cryptocurrencies In Malaysia

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Malaysia but are classified as securities getty Cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender in Malaysia. The Central Bank of Malaysia Act establishes the ringgit as the country's sole legal tender, effectively excluding cryptocurrencies from this status. While the Act doesn't explicitly prohibit cryptocurrencies, it limits the definition of legal tender to the ringgit. However, cryptocurrencies are classified as securities under the Capital Markets and Services Order. This classification gives them a defined legal status within Malaysia's financial regulatory framework. There have been calls from within the government to adopt a more progressive stance towards cryptocurrencies. In March 2022, Zahidi Zainul Abidin, the deputy minister of the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, suggested that Malaysia should adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender. "We hope the government can allow this," Zahidi said in Parliament, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, religious authorities in Malaysia, such as the Shariah Advisory Council of the Securities Commission, have recognized digital currencies as a form of property from an Islamic perspective, further legitimizing their use within the country's predominantly Muslim society, according to a study published in the Journal of Fatwa and Falak Selangor. Regulatory Framework And Key Legislation Bank Negara Malaysia, the country's central bank, is the primary authority overseeing cryptocurrency matters in Malaysia. The key legislative acts governing cryptocurrency regulation: The Central Bank of Malaysia Act: Defines legal tender and BNM's authority over monetary policy. The Financial Services Act: Regulates financial institutions and payment systems, including those related to cryptocurrencies. The Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act: Combats illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. The Capital Markets and Services Order further strengthens the regulatory framework by classifying certain digital currencies and tokens as securities. This brings them under the purview of the Securities Commission Malaysia, imposing additional compliance requirements on cryptocurrency businesses, including obtaining necessary licenses to operate legally. Organizers of unregistered coin offerings may face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million Malaysian ringgit (approximately $2.5 million).

However, infrequent traders may be able to classify their earnings as capital gains, which are not taxable in Malaysia, according to a research in The Journal of Management Theory and Practice. The government has recently stepped up enforcement of these tax regulations Crackdown On Crypto Tax Evasion In June 2024, Malaysia's Inland Revenue Board launched a special operation called "Ops Token" to address tax revenue leakage from cryptocurrency trading. The operation involved raids on 10 locations in the Klang Valley, conducted by 38 personnel from the Royal Malaysia Police and CyberSecurity Malaysia, according to Cointelegraph. The IRB CEO, Datuk Abu Tariq Jamaluddin, warned crypto traders to declare their taxes promptly or face compliance actions. "Through the operation, cryptocurrency trading data stored in mobile devices and computers were found, and we successfully identified the value of digital assets being traded, which caused a very significant leakage of tax revenue," the IRB stated. Crackdown On Illegal Bitcoin Mining While cryptocurrency mining itself is not prohibited in Malaysia, authorities have intensified efforts against illegal operations using stolen electricity. In August 2024, seven individuals were arrested for such activities, as reported by Cointelegraph. The scale of the problem is significant, with the country's deputy energy minister revealing that illegal crypto-mining operations cost an estimated $723 million in stolen electricity between 2018 and 2023. In a display of enforcement, Malaysian authorities used a steamroller to destroy 985 confiscated Bitcoin mining rigs valued at $452,000. This action echoed a similar event in 2021 when $1.25 million worth of mining equipment was destroyed. Challenges And Future Directions Despite Malaysia's efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies, significant challenges remain. According to the study published in the Journal of Fatwa and Falak Selangor, the current regulatory framework lacks comprehensive legislation specifically tailored to digital assets. This gap creates uncertainty for businesses and investors operating in the cryptocurrency space. One key issue, as highlighted in research from the Journal of Management Theory and Practice, is the absence of clear guidelines for consumer protection in cryptocurrency transactions. Unlike traditional financial products, crypto investments lack safeguards against fraud or market manipulation. Additionally, the regulatory framework doesn't adequately address the technological complexities of blockchain and decentralized finance. To improve its regulatory landscape, Malaysia could consider: Developing comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation to provide legal clarity. Implementing stronger consumer protection measures for crypto investors. Establishing a licensing framework for cryptocurrency businesses, similar to Singapore's model. Enhancing collaboration between regulatory bodies to address the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrencies. "Regulations can also vary depending on the state, as different regions may have distinct local laws, especially regarding Islamic finance principles. This regulatory fragmentation can pose challenges for businesses and crypto users, who must navigate both federal guidelines and state-specific rulings," said Andrey Kuznetsov, co-founder and CTO at Haqq Blockchain, in an email statement. Balancing innovation with regulatory compliance will be vital for cryptocurrencies in Malaysia. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

                    Bitcoin and crypto stocks sink after last week's rally, but still head for a positive September
                </h3>

                            Analysts have also warned about overbought conditions as bitcoin last week climbed nearly 5% in the five days ending Sept. 27 – as net inflows into global crypto exchange traded products accelerated to their highest level since mid-July. In the same period, Coinbase and MicroStrategy gained 12% and 21%, respectively. On Friday both stocks jumped 6%. The combined net buying volume of U.S. bitcoin ETFs last week (16,774 BTC) exceeded a typical one-month supply of newly mined bitcoin (13,500), according to Bitwise-owned ETC Group. This was largely due to the policy reversal by the People's Bank of China, the firm said. For the month, bitcoin is on pace to finish its strongest September ever with an 8% gain and its second positive September – historically the cryptocurrency's weakest month – in a row. Coinbase is poised for a 4% monthly gain but is down nearly 14% for the quarter. Some analysts see that downtrend continuing in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy is up 33% for the month and almost 28% for the quarter. The market is heading into a seasonally strong quarter for crypto and risk assets broadly. Bitcoin's narrative is often debated — whether it's a store of value or a risk asset — but its correlation is currently closer to that of the S&P 500 than to gold, and investors expect it to benefit from rate cuts, clarity following the U.S. presidential election and seasonal and favorable market conditions translating into greater flows into crypto ETFs.

                    Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Solana, and more: Cryptocurrencies to watch this week
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The cryptocurrency market is poised to enter the new quarter with renewed optimism, fueled by recent interest rate cuts and the anticipation surrounding the upcoming November election. Regardless of the outcome, both major political sides have hinted at policies that could be favorable to the crypto industry, further boosting investor confidence. With this optimistic outlook, let’s take a closer look at the cryptocurrencies currently making waves in the cryptosphere. Dogecoin (DOGE) The biggest memecoin by market cap, Dogecoin, is experiencing a significant surge, driven by a combination of factors. Key among these is the recent interest rate cuts announced in September, which have injected fresh optimism into the broader cryptocurrency market. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.12, marking a substantial 13% increase over the past seven days. One expert has predicted an explosive rally for Dogecoin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, Dogecoin’s main rival and another popular memecoin, has seen a significant surge in recent days. The primary driver behind this rally is the burn rate, which spiked by an impressive 640%, with approximately 1 million SHIB tokens burned in a single transaction, according to data from Shibburn. In total, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has removed 5.56 million SHIB tokens from circulation over the past 24 hours. For those unfamiliar, coin burning is the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. The goal is to reduce the supply of tokens, which, in turn, can increase the value of the remaining coins. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001837, reflecting a 27% increase over the past week. Pepe (PEPE) The rapid growth of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has also propelled other memecoins, such as Pepe—a frog-themed cryptocurrency that now ranks among the top 30 by market capitalization. Riding the wave of bullish market sentiment, Pepe has surged over 36% in the past week and is currently trading at $0.00001096. Solana (SOL) Solana, a major competitor to Ethereum and home to hundreds of decentralized apps, has seen recent growth, driven by a bullish report from VanEck. The report predicts that Solana could reach $330, potentially capturing 50% of Ethereum’s current market capitalization. VanEck highlights Solana’s superior transaction speed—processing over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum’s 15-45 TPS—as a key factor behind its strong outlook. This speed advantage makes Solana especially attractive for high-volume transactions, such as payments and remittances. Currently, Solana is trading at $155, reflecting an 8% increase over the past week. XRP (XRP) XRP has been surging in response to a new project from Ripple, the blockchain technology company behind the cryptocurrency. Ripple is preparing to launch a stablecoin called RLUSD, which will be pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. The stablecoin will be fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, recently suggested that the official launch of RLUSD could happen before the end of 2024. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.47, showing an 8% increase over the past week.

                    Bitcoin Dips 3% as Crypto Market Follows Global Trends
                </h3>

                            The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn on Monday morning, with Bitcoin leading the decline. Bitcoin’s price fell by nearly 3%, dragging other digital currencies along with it. This shift mirrored the global stock market’s negative trend. The week ahead promises important employment data from the United States. The most anticipated report, the payroll data, will be released on Friday. The Federal Reserve will likely use this information to guide its next interest rate decision. Recently, the Fed reduced the basic interest rate by 0.50 percentage points. Analysts expect another rate cut at the upcoming meeting, depending on economic indicators. Cryptocurrency futures contracts worth approximately $140 million were liquidated in the past 24 hours. This liquidation reflects the market’s current volatility and uncertainty. Investors remain cautious as they await further economic signals. Despite the current dip, the crypto market shows signs of long-term optimism. The fourth quarter traditionally brings favorable conditions for digital currencies. Analysts predict a “perfect storm” of positive factors in the coming months. Anticipated events include potential interest rate cuts in the US and the conclusion of the American elections. These factors could increase market liquidity and drive cryptocurrency prices higher. October, nicknamed “Uptober,” historically sees rising prices in the crypto market. Bitcoin Dips 3% as Crypto Market Follows Global Trends Recent data supports this optimistic outlook. Investment vehicles for digital assets reported their third consecutive week of resource inflows. Last week alone saw an influx of $1.2 billion into these investment products. The approval of options for certain US-based investment products likely boosted market sentiment. However, trading volumes have not seen a proportional increase. This discrepancy suggests cautious optimism among investors. Despite the positive long-term outlook, investors should remain mindful of the crypto market’s volatility. Experts advise maintaining a responsible portion of investments in digital assets. Balancing potential gains with risk management remains crucial in this dynamic market.

                    Crypto Wallet Drainer App Identified on Google Play Store: Report

                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            A report by Check Point Research (CPR) uncovered a crypto wallet draining app on the Google Play Store, masquerading as the popular WalletConnect app. CPR found that the app used "advanced evasion techniques" to steal $70,000 (roughly Rs. 58.6 lakh) over five months from unsuspecting users. The malicious app, named "MS Drainer" after an analysis of its JavaScript code, is part of a growing trend of increasingly sophisticated crypto scams. Recent FBI reports also warn that cybercriminals have become more efficient in executing global attacks. “Check Point Research (CPR) uncovered a malicious app on Google Play Store designed to steal cryptocurrency marking the first time a drainer has targeted mobile device users exclusively. To pose as a legitimate tool for Web3 apps, the attackers exploited the trusted name of the WalletConnect protocol, which connects crypto wallets to decentralised apps,” the report said. The crypto wallet app, that has now been removed, managed to amass over 10,000 downloads. The fake platform emerged on top of the search on Google Play Store on searching for ‘WalletConnect' owing to multiple reviews that the CPR report flagged as ‘fake'.YouTube Restores Access After Scammers Hijack Ranveer Allahbadia's Channel What is WalletConnect WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that connects decentralised apps (dApps) with crypto wallets through QR codes, allowing users to interact with blockchain-based apps without exposing their private keys. According to Check Point Research (CPR), a fake app mimicking WalletConnect's appearance and functions was created using the web service Median.co. The app, initially named "Mestox Calculator," was published on the Google Play Store on March 21, 2024, with its name changed several times since then. “An inexperienced user might conclude that it is a separate wallet application that needs to be downloaded and installed. Attackers hijack the confusion, hoping that users will search for a WalletConnect app in the application store,” the report noted.Binance Claims It Helped ED Crack Fiewin Gaming Scam: All Details The X handle of WalletConnect acknowledged the development in a note to its followers. The WalletConnect Foundation is aware of a recent scam where bad actors developed a malicious app that exploited the WalletConnect name and was available on the Google Play Store. The app has been removed from Google Play Store. The Foundation reminds everyone that there is no… — WalletConnect (@WalletConnect) September 29, 2024 How Did WalletConnet's Malicious Dupe Work Upon download, the fake app quickly prompted users to connect their crypto wallets. When users clicked the wallet buttons, they were redirected to a malicious website via a deep link. To verify their wallets, the website requested users to approve multiple transactions consecutively, unknowingly authorizing fraudulent activity. “We assume that users install this malicious app to connect their wallet to Web3 applications that do not support direct connections to wallets like MetaMask, Binance Wallet, or Trust Wallet, but only use the WalletConnect protocol. They likely expect the downloaded WalletConnect app to function as a sort of proxy. Therefore, the connection request does not appear suspicious,” the report explained. The CPR, in its report, said incidents like these highlight the advance nature of techniques that are being used to target the crypto sector, that is presently valued at $2.27 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,90,20,364 crore). The website has strongly suggested users remain vigilant and wary of the applications they download, even when they appear legitimate. Back in 2023, a Sophos report stated that crypto scammers have been fishing for victims on Android systems using AI tools. Crypto fraudsters were also identified to be exploiting advertisements on Google Search to promote scam websites. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }

                    Bitcoin Community Prepares For 'Uptober' Surge After 3-Week Spike
                </h3>

                            Bitcoin users are pumped and excited about the upcoming month, as historical charts show that the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value performs relatively well during the third quarter of the year.Many BTC enthusiasts and analysts are already making bold predictions, especially after the digital currency logged a three-week surge ahead of "Uptober," a term the crypto community uses to describe the historic increases in the crypto market during October.'Uptober' Incoming Following Strong 3-Week PerformanceLeading on-chain data and analytics provider CryptoQuant noted how BTC logged a 23% increase in the past three weeks, climbing from $52,500 to over $65,000.The analytics platform further noted that Bitcoin's solid performance was partly driven by an apparent spike in demand for spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Farside Investors data shows that U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded a seven-day positive flows streak, with Friday alone hauling in nearly $495 million.BlackRock's IBIT was still the leader among U.S.-listed BTC ETFs, recording nearly $500 million in inflows last week.Institutional Interest to Drive Further Uptick?The Bitcoin Therapist, a well-followed Bitcoiner on X, said that while BTC has a track record of performing well at the start of the fourth quarter, "the main difference between this cycle and the last one is that now we have trillion dollar institutions that understand it." He went on to predict that the BTC community may not be prepared for the upcoming bull run.There has been a significant increase in traditional financial institutions getting into the Bitcoin game in recent months, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.Crypto infrastructure provider Fireblocks recently revealed that activity among institutional investors surged over the past year, growing by 85% in July compared to the same month in 2023.Bitcoin's Silent EvolutionCrypto investment firm HashKey Capital noted in a new report that BTC has been evolving "quietly but significantly" in the first half of the year amid the rise of technological innovations around the digital coin.Innovations focused on cross-chain interoperability and the emergence of yield-focused strategies such as BTC staking could open new investment paths, which could then help drive more engagement and interest in the Bitcoin network.Bitcoin has retreated below $64,000 after breaking above $65,000 late last week. On the other hand, zooming out will show that last week was relatively good for the digital asset, as it even hit $66,000 at one point on Saturday.Also, considering the time it took for the token to climb above $65,000, BTC has still outperformed many other cryptocurrencies in the market today. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will follow its historical "Uptober" pattern, but so far, charts suggest it is on the right track.

                    Decentralized AI, SocialFi, Philanthropic NFTs – Projects Pitched To Binance's CZ After Prison Release

                            Binance co-founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao confirmed Saturday he has been released from prison after four months in jail for failing to provide users of the popular cryptocurrency exchange with adequate security protections.CZ took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his gratefulness and also revealed his plans moving forward. Many crypto users welcomed him back to the industry, and others took the opportunity to pitch themselves, given Zhao's announcement shortly after his sentencing that he will continue to invest in blockchain and crypto.Others had a different agenda, including a growing number of commenters on his post who, throughout the weekend, urged the crypto leader to help victims of the massive WazirX exploit that saw over $230 million in losses.Here are the top projects that crypto users and teams pitched to Zhao for his consideration.Ceti – Decentralizing Artificial IntelligenceCeti, a decentralized AI project, welcomed CZ back into the crypto space, revealing that the team has been "accumulating hardware and setting up decentralized AI compute to provide companies that want a truly decentralized system."Some crypto users tagged Zhao in the Ceti team's comment, saying the project will make a huge impact on the future of AI.According to the Ceti website, the team is on a mission to build high-performance, scalable, and globally distributed AI infrastructure to enable distributed networks and developers "to rapidly outpace the capabilities and reach of centralized AI."Arena – 'Next-Gen' SocialFi AppOne user pitched the Arena SocialFi (social finance) app to the crypto mogul, saying it "opens the door to the future of SocialFi." Crypto token and non-fungible token (NFT) enthusiasts took to the comments section to support the idea of Zhao possibly checking out Arena.The decentralized social media platform comes with the $ARENA token, which is a governance token that is freely transferable when claimed. Arena describes itself as a project "born 'by the people, for the people,'" where creators can unite and engage.Impact Digital Art – NFTs With a PurposeThe project heaped praise on Zhao's comeback post, wherein he talked about his plans for charity and education after his time in jail. The team said it would appreciate CZ's backing.According to the Impact Digital Art website, the project is an NFT marketplace where "art, Web3, technology, and social, humanitarian and environmental impact walk all together."The team also has a token project, the IDART coin, which it said was created for the purpose of supporting charity causes, including climate-related initiatives.One user commented on the pitch, saying it was good to find token projects "with a real and good purpose and not only s***coins in the market."Many other commenters pitched a host of crypto tokens, including NEIRO, RUNES, and MSI. Other crypto users focused on celebrating Zhao's freedom.What Zhao SaidWhile CZ has yet to comment on the pitched projects, his post revealed what he has been doing in the months when he served time and also provided a preview of what he will do next. Giggle Academy – Zhao announced his new project shortly after his sentencing. The educational platform will provide free learning materials that will utilize blockchain-based tokens for student achievements. He said the project is doing well and "will be a big part of my life for the next few years." Investments – CZ said he will continue to invest in blockchain and decentralized technologies, as well as AI and biotech. "I am a long term investor who care[s] about impact, not returns," he wrote. Charity Funding – The former Binance CEO, who had to step down from his post as part of his guilty plea, said he will dedicate more time and funding to charitable initiatives and education. Book – Zhao said he is working on a book that's "about 2/3 done." Zhao was supposed to be freed Sunday, but Bloomberg reported that he was released Friday. Aside from leaving his CEO role at Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, CZ also agreed to pay a $50 million fine as part of his guilty plea, while Binance agreed to pay a staggering $4 billion penalty.

                    How U.S. Crypto Regulation Trends Impact UK Businesses
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The cryptocurrency landscape is rapidly evolving, and with it, the regulatory frameworks govern it. Recently, U.S. regulators, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have intensified their scrutiny of the crypto industry. This crackdown has raised questions about the future of cryptocurrency, not just in the United States but also in other countries, including the UK. Understanding these U.S. regulatory trends is crucial for businesses in the UK that accept or deal in cryptocurrencies. While crypto payment solutions like the Bybit Card may offer growth opportunities, the regulatory environment must be navigated carefully. The U.S. Regulatory Landscape In the United States, the SEC has expressed concerns about the prevalence of fraud within the cryptocurrency sector, labeling it as “rife with fraud and hucksters.” Chair Gary Gensler highlighted that the investing public has lost significant amounts of money due to crypto companies not adhering to established laws. This has led to a surge in enforcement actions, with the SEC taking a record number of measures against firms trying to exploit the emerging technology. The political dynamics surrounding cryptocurrency have also shifted dramatically. For instance, former President Donald Trump has reversed his earlier stance, now advocating for the U.S. to become “the crypto capital of the planet.” His promise to create a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile signals a potentially favorable environment for crypto businesses. This contrasts sharply with the Biden administration, which has implemented stricter regulations and a crackdown on firms, including high-profile cases like that of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, who was sentenced to 25 years for fraud. Implications for UK Businesses 1. Increased Compliance Burdens UK businesses that engage in cryptocurrency transactions should be prepared for the possibility of increased compliance requirements. As U.S. regulators tighten their grip on the industry, there is a strong likelihood that similar measures could be adopted in the UK. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has already been active in regulating crypto firms, and it may feel pressure to align its policies more closely with those of the U.S. This could lead to stricter reporting and transparency requirements for UK businesses dealing with crypto. 2. Shifting Consumer Confidence The perception of cryptocurrency among consumers can greatly affect business operations. With the ongoing regulatory crackdown in the U.S., many individuals may become wary of investing in cryptocurrencies, fearing losses due to fraud or regulatory action. UK businesses should be aware of these shifting sentiments. They might need to implement strategies to build consumer trust, such as providing clear information about compliance, security measures, and how they are safeguarding customer funds. 3. Market Dynamics and Competitive Edge The political landscape in the U.S. has led to significant investments in cryptocurrency businesses, with millions spent on political donations aimed at influencing regulatory outcomes. This has created an environment where companies are attempting to sway lawmakers to adopt more favorable regulations. In contrast, UK businesses may find themselves competing against these U.S. firms, which could benefit from more supportive regulations. UK businesses must adapt to this competitive landscape by ensuring they are compliant and leveraging any advantages they have, such as operating in a more stable regulatory environment. 4. Opportunities for Innovation While regulatory challenges may seem daunting, they can also present opportunities for UK businesses to innovate. As U.S. regulators crack down on bad actors in the crypto space, legitimate businesses can differentiate themselves by adhering to high standards of compliance and transparency. This can help establish credibility and attract customers who are cautious about entering the crypto market. By focusing on ethical practices and security, UK businesses can carve out a niche for themselves, positioning themselves as leaders in a regulated environment. 5. Global Collaboration The interconnected nature of the global economy means that regulatory actions in the U.S. can have ripple effects around the world. As the G20 works on setting minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, UK businesses should actively engage in discussions about regulations that not only protect consumers but also foster innovation. Collaborating with other countries on establishing best practices can help ensure that the UK remains a competitive player in the global crypto market. Conclusion The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency is continuously evolving, particularly in the United States. UK businesses must remain vigilant and informed about these changes, as they can significantly impact operations and consumer trust. While challenges abound, there are also opportunities for businesses that embrace compliance and transparency. As the crypto industry matures, it will be essential for UK companies to adopt best practices and engage in discussions that shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation. By doing so, they can not only navigate the complexities of the current environment but also thrive in a landscape where responsible innovation is the key to success. Understanding the trends and dynamics from the U.S. can help UK businesses prepare for the future, ultimately leading to a more robust and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.

                    Former Chinese finance official urges crypto research as US softens stance

                            Cryptocurrencies are “crucial” for the digital economy and China should catch up as the US embraces the industry, according to a former senior Ministry of Finance official, as more experts openly urge the central government to re-evaluate its ban on the virtual assets. Crypto policy in the US has “changed significantly” this year, and China should study its impact and other global policy developments for the sector, Zhu Guangyao, China’s former finance vice-minister, said on Saturday during a panel discussion at an economic forum in Beijing. While cryptocurrencies have risks and could harm the capital market, it is also a “crucial aspect for the development of the entire digital economy”, he added. Zhu, who was second in command at the finance ministry from 2010 to 2018, is among a growing number of Chinese economists calling for Beijing to review its crypto ban on the mainland amid a global expansion in recent years. Beijing first banned initial coin offerings and ordered the closure of crypto exchanges in 2017. It intensified its crackdown in 2021, when it banned bitcoin mining and declared crypto-related business to be illegal. Chinese authorities consider cryptoassets to be a threat to financial stability and a breeding ground for criminal activity. Zhu said the risks from cryptocurrencies – which include impacts on countering terrorist financing and anti-money-laundering efforts, as well as capital market volatility – can be addressed through regulation. “Our current gap [with the US] is that we don’t participate,” Zhu said. “Even with such restrictions, underground trading channels still exist, but you don’t have the ability to utilise it for production because it is prohibited by law.” “Therefore, we need to study new issues, confront them directly, discuss, and resolve them,” he added. Since 2022, Hong Kong has been developing its crypto market, as a separate legal jurisdiction, in an effort to become a global hub for such business with the implicit approval of Beijing. Regulations on the mainland have remained unchanged. While mainland investors have still found ways to trade cryptoassets, there have also been calls for the government to loosen its strict ban as other markets, the US in particular, have taken a more welcoming stance. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in an effort to appeal to cryptocurrency investors, said at a bitcoin conference in July that the US must embrace crypto to avoid letting China “dominate”. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris earlier this month also said that she would encourage “innovative technologies” such as digital assets. Banning crypto mining in China was “very unwise” because it drove business to the US, Wang Yang, vice-president for institutional advancement and chair professor of mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said during a panel discussion in July. If former US president Trump retakes the White House, Wang said, China could be removed from the Swift financial messaging system or at least face restrictions, Wang claimed. The country should also look into tokenisation as a way to prepare for decoupling risks, he added. In late 2022, Chinese economist Huang Yiping, a former member of the monetary policy committee at the People’s Bank of China, also said China should consider whether its cryptocurrency ban was sustainable in the long run, as it could miss opportunities in technologies such as blockchain.

                    HongShan Joins $7.8 Million Funding Round Of Hong Kong Fintech Startup RD Technologies

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Norman Chan, founder and chairman of RD Technologies. Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg RD Technologies, a Hong Kong-based fintech startup founded by the ex-chief executive of the city’s de facto central bank, said on Thursday it raised $7.8 million from investors including billionaire Neil Shen’s venture capital giant HongShan, formerly Sequoia China. The Series A1 round has also attracted the likes of digital asset-focused funds, including U.S.-based Hivemind Capital Partners; Aptos Labs, a blockchain startup founded by ex-Meta employees who worked on the social media giant’s failed Diem stablecoin project; as well as Solana Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the Solana blockchain network, RD Technologies said in a statement. The fresh funds will allow RD Technologies to continue building a platform that helps bridge traditional and decentralized finance, it said in a press release. The startup recently expanded into the digital asset space, riding on Hong Kong’s push to become a cryptocurrency hub. Earlier this year, RD Technologies announced plans to issue stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and backed by reserves of cash and cash equivalents. “The legacy payment industry is ripe to be disrupted using blockchain technology and stablecoins to provide more efficient and cheaper cross-border payment networks,” Rita Liu, CEO of RD Technologies, said in the statement. “We are confident that compliant and transparent stablecoins will invigorate the market and address the pain points of traditional payments and finance to bring in institutions and help Hong Kong become a global Web3 hub.” The former CEO of Alipay’s U.K. unit, Liu joined RD Technologies in 2023 as COO and was promoted to the top job in February this year. RD Technologies was founded in 2020 by Norman Chan, the ex-chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the former Asia vice chairman of Standard Chartered Bank. The startup has developed a mobile wallet for enterprises, which allows cross-border payment and foreign exchange of multiple fiat currencies. It has previously drawn investments from backers including crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, Hong Kong crypto unicorn Hashkey Group and ZhongAn Digital Asset, a subsidiary of China’s ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance. Following its recent crypto venture, RD Technologies in July was admitted to Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s stablecoin trials, which would test the crypto tokens in applications such as cross-border payment and settlement. Joining the regulatory trials are also Jingdong Coinlink Technology Hong Kong, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce behemoth JD.com, as well as a joint venture between Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li’s telecoms operator HKT, local blockchain gaming unicorn Animoca Brands and Standard Chartered Bank. The stablecoin market is currency dominated by U.S. dollar-pegged tokens, Tether Operations’ USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC. The tokens hold the promise of stability in face of high volatility in the crypto market, but have instead brought chaos in the past. The biggest failure was stablecoin variant TerraUSD, which failed to maintain its $1 peg in 2022 and triggered a $60 billion wipeout in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Circle’s USDC stablecoins in 2023 briefly lost its dollar peg after revealing it had $3.3 billion stuck at the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank, raising questions about the crypto tokens’ stability.
