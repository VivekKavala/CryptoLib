                    Ether Shows Its Strength After Prices Near ‘Extreme Undervalued Levels’

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Ether bounced back this week. (Photo by S3studio/Getty Images) 2018 S3studio Ether has shown its strength recently, bouncing back after becoming severely undervalued compared to bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value rose above $2,700 this week, reaching its highest value since late August, Coinbase figures provided by TradingView reveal. The digital asset has rallied close to 20% since September 18, additional Coinbase data reveals. This upward movement started the same day the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it was cutting the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points, a move that provided tailwinds for global risk assets. “Basically all crypto has been rallying since the Fed rate cut, but ETH has rallied stronger than Bitcoin, for example, because it has underperformed Bitcoin since The Merge (September 2022) and is now approaching extreme undervalued levels against it,” Moreno said via Telegram. The chart below, which leverages CryptoQuant data, helps depict this situation. The black line shows the ratio of ether prices to those of bitcoin. The purple line, on the other hand, displays the Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) of ether relative to that of bitcoin.

Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, September 25 Ether and bitcoin's price and Market Value to Realised Value CryptoQuant Ether’s ‘Recent Underperformance’ Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also emphasized how ether’s price has failed to keep up with that of bitcoin. “ETH has been underperforming BTC for most of the summer,” he stated via email. “That started to change with the US Federal Reserve’s 50 bps reduction in interest rates as, for some reason, ETH has reacted more bullishly than BTC,” Enneking noted. “The only reason we can come up with is that ETH is simply compensating for its recent underperformance,” he specified. “We do not see this as a secular shift back to the BTC-ETH ratio before ETH switched to POS from POW,” Enneking clarified. Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, also weighed in, offering a similar take. “Ethereum is currently experiencing a price recovery, but this seems more like a correction than a rally, as it has been undervalued in recent weeks,” she said via email. “On September 20th, the ETH/BTC ratio dipped to 0.038, its lowest point since April 2021, signaling that Ethereum had been priced too cheaply,” Liu added. “Last week, Ethereum's price erased all of its year-to-date gains, as if the much-anticipated ETH ETF had never happened,” she stated, shedding further light on the matter. “Meanwhile, alternative Layer 1s like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) have posted strong performances this year,” the analyst noted. “This underscores the clear undervaluation of ETH, and the current price recovery appears to be aligning it with the broader market.” Bullish Outlook Going forward, ether could be headed for substantial gains, stated Liu. “Ethereum is showing signs of repeating its 2021 pattern, with a potential for significant upside and volatility ahead,” she said. “The Ethereum blockchain continues to dominate, with the most active developers, the largest number of active users, and has a market cap almost five times that of its competitor Solana. With strong fundamentals, it seems poised for another potential rally, Liu concluded. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                    Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) rally hard, yet analysts remain bullish on Rexas Finance (RXS) as the real winner
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            In the last few weeks, cryptocurrency has been in favour of XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) among many other coins. Both of these coins have witnessed a substantial amount of price appreciation lately. Positive news for XRP emerged on the regulatory front, whereas for Dogecoin, the community supporters and the likes of Elon Musk have not stopped talking and backing the token. However, while these price movements are occurring, several analysts are slowly turning their attention to Rexas Finance (RXS) – the upcoming cryptocurrency in the market, which will excel in the future because of its unique strategy on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Ripple (XRP): Fueled by Regulatory Clarity XRP, the token of the Ripple network, has been in many circumstantial difficulties for these past few years. Most reports daily would be the litigation they have with the SEC. Despite this uncertainty, since the price of XRP was at an all-time low, even hostile, it still was gaining value and more recently appeared to shoot up substantively thanks to what many saw as positive verdicts, all of which pointed towards regulatory certainty. This has instilled much-needed faith among consumers, thereby uplifting the price of XRP to around $0.50 and above. Even though the performance of XRP’s price rally is optimistic, analysts believe that the future evolution of this cryptocurrency may depend on the outcome of the legal battles it faces. With regulatory clarity, XRP will certainly increase in value in the long run; however, until the case is completed, a certain degree of risk is involved for the investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Surge Continues Dogecoin (DOGE), the famous meme coin, refuses to stop its internal rally, driven by the strong community and support from many, including the Twitter king Elon Musk. Priced around $0.06, the sell-off of Dogecoin, in particular its core supporter base and adoption in the economy rather than in the volume of transactions, nevertheless, surprised many investors. The advantages of making transactions in the Dogecoin network include low fees and an increasing number of businesses willing to accept it as a form of payment. Such companies like Tesla offer some of their products in exchange for DOGE and this increases the marketability of the currency further. On the other hand, Dogecoin is only as good as its community perception, as its value is not backed by any fundamental reason. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining Tokenization With XRP and Dogecoin thriving on their surges, it seems some analysts are forecasting the future of Rexas Finance rather positively. This emerging token is attracting attention with its distinct emphasis on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, offering users a chance to tokenize note assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This form of approach creates multi-trillion-dollar industries that were once out of reach to average investors. What Makes Rexas Finance Distinct from Others? RWA Tokenization: Instead of concentrating on speculative tokens, Rexas Finance has a proactive approach to the real world as it introduces RWA as a fractional ownership model of physical assets to the masses. This allows the normal population to invest in high-valuation assets such as real estate. High-Upside Growth: Currently, the Rexas Finance (RXS) presale is ongoing with each token going for $0.05. The sale has already gotten funding of over $1.25 million. Moreover, the analysts predict that these values will dramatically increase, possibly reaching up to & $20 towards the end of 2025, which represents a remarkable increase in value of up to 50,000%. Whale Interest: Already, Rexas Finance has started enticing whale investors. People who were holding tokens like XRP and Dogecoin, who were early adopters, are set to reap the longer-term growth of Rexas Finance’s vision. Comprehensive Ecosystem: To this end, Rexas Finance has enhanced the flexibility and security of the platform by offering tools such as the Rexas Token Builder and AI-based smart contract auditing using its AI Shield. Such characteristics are attractive not only to private persons but also to companies and institutions that wish to tokenize their assets. Conclusion: How Good is the Opportunity with Rexas Finance? As XRP and Dogecoin remain among the loved and favoured crypto assets, Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be the healthiest option for the right long-term investors. The combination of asset tokenization in the real world together with the spiking upside potential has indeed turned the heads of analysts and whale investors. In the coming years, Rexas Finance may probably be one of the greatest tokens of the crypto space as more people get used to the idea of tokenizing actual assets.

                </h3>

                            Cryptocurrency staking is a process in which owners of digital assets temporarily blockchain their coins to support a blockchain based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm or variations of it, such as Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). In exchange for providing their coins for this purpose, participants in the staking receive a reward in the form of new cryptocurrency tokens. The basic principles of steaking as a way to generate income: Network Support: Staking participants play an important role in decentralized networks by acting as validators that verify and validate transactions, which contributes to the security and stability of the blockchain. Reward: Users receive additional tokens as a reward for supporting the network. This reward can be viewed as analogous to interest income on invested assets. Returns and risks: Returns from steaking vary across blockchain networks and can depend on factors such as the number of coins blocked, how long they are held, and the inflation rate of the cryptocurrency. It is worth considering the risks, including possible price fluctuations of the steaked assets and penalties for incorrect transactions (slashing). Examples of popular stealth cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH) – Since the transition to Ethereum 2.0, the network has become one of the largest networks in the world to actively utilize staking. Solana (SOL) – A high-performance blockchain platform that utilizes the Proof of Stake algorithm. Solana staking helps maintain the speed and scalability of the network, and participants receive rewards in the form of SOL. Tezos (XTZ) is one of the first cryptocurrencies to support the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).. In Tezos, users can delegate their tokens to validators and receive rewards even without having a large amount of coins Stacking continues to gain popularity as it provides an opportunity to earn passive income while supporting blockchain networks. Example of cryptocurrency steaking on EXMO platform EXMO is a cryptocurrency exchange established in 2013 that provides a wide range of services for trading cryptocurrencies. Initially focused on the European market, the exchange is actively developing in the African market, offering its functions to users in Nigeria. EXMO attracts users with its user-friendly interface, low commissions and an extensive selection of trading pairs. One of the platform’s products is its own token EXMO Coin (EXM), which gives users many benefits such as reduced commissions, access to exclusive features and participation in referral programs. EXMO offers the following financial products: Steaking EXMO Coin (EXM): The exchange provides the ability to steak your own EXM token. This allows users to earn passive income simply for storing EXM tokens on the exchange balance. To participate in steaking, users need to have a certain minimum number of EXM tokens. Rewards for staking are credited automatically, usually at a certain frequency (e.g. once a month). Steaking other cryptocurrencies: In addition to EXM, EXMO supports steaking of other popular cryptocurrencies such as USD Coin (USDC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT). An important advantage is the ability to to purchase steaking cryptocurrencies for the Nigerian naira (NGN) directly through the EXMO app. Steakin’ terms: Flexible and fixed plans: The platform offers different types of staking plans, including flexible (with the ability to withdraw funds at any time) and fixed (with a set lock-in period for funds). Yield: Interest rates vary depending on the selected cryptocurrency and staking plan. Generally, fixed plans provide higher rates compared to flexible plans. Special Steakin’ Conditions: One of the key advantages of the EXMO platform is the regular provision of special offers for steaking, valid for a limited period. For example, in September 2024, several programs are available to EXMO users, including an exclusive offer – a one-day bitcoin steaking promotion with maximum yield. The annualized interest rate on this one-day steaking reaches an impressive 1000%! For more information on current special offers on cryptocurrency steaking, including terms and conditions for Nigerian users, please visit the link: https://exmo.com/earn How to start crypto steak: Register on the EXMO platform and pass the verification procedure. Refill the balance with the desired cryptocurrency. In the financial products section, select the appropriate steak plan and confirm your participation. Receive rewards depending on the selected plan. Rewards can be automatically reinvested or withdrawn by the user. How good is steaking on EXMO? Convenient: The simple and intuitive interface allows users to easily start steaking, even if they are new to cryptocurrency. Reliable: EXMO is one of the most well-known and time-tested crypto exchanges that provides a high level of security and trust. Additional benefits: Using the EXM token provides additional benefits such as discounts on commissions and access to unique offers. Risks and cautions: Market Fluctuations: The value of EXM and other steaked cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly, which can affect your overall profit from steaking. Check current conditions before taking action Locking of funds: Depending on the terms of the staking, funds may be frozen for a certain period of time, which reduces their liquidity. Security: Despite the platform’s high level of security, there is always a risk of hacking and technical problems. Users are advised to enable all available account protection measures, such as two-factor authentication. Concluded Steaking on the EXMO platform offers users, including those from Nigeria, the opportunity to generate passive income from cryptocurrencies, including the EXM token. Before you start steaking, it is recommended to carefully read the current terms and interest rates presented on the official EXMO website, as well as assess the possible risks.

                            The clampdown on cryptocurrencies in the US this year has been mirrored in Europe. In April, the European Union agreed new laws to try to reduce the risk of crypto being used by criminals. However, other regulators are being slower to act. The G20 group of leading economies is working on minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, but they are not legally binding, and uptake has been slow. Back in the US, a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been passed by the House, but not the Senate. Its critics argue it will give less protection to consumers. Coinbase’s Mr Grewal backs the bill, and says: “This is not an industry that is shying away from regulation.” He adds that the sector just wants the same standards applied to crypto as are applied to other assets, “no tougher, but no weaker”.

                    Ireland To Streamline Licensing Process For Crypto Businesses

                            Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Ireland's Central Bank is streamlining its crypto company authorization process as the EU prepares ... [+] to implement MiCAR. getty Ireland's Central Bank is enhancing its authorization process for crypto companies as the European Union prepares to implement the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. Deputy Governor Derville Rowland announced this development during a speech at AFME's 8th Annual European Compliance and Legal Conference on September 23, 2024. The authorization process, which crypto businesses must complete to operate legally in Ireland, involves regulatory approval of a company's financial stability, risk management systems, and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Rowland stated, "We have been working to continually improve our authorisation process," adding, "Better risk assessment, better communication and better supervisory outcomes have been the output of that work." This move comes as part of Ireland's preparation for MiCAR, a EU-wide regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCAR aims to establish consistent rules across EU member states for crypto-asset issuers and service providers. "We are working closely with our EU Peers and the ESAs to ensure the necessary coordination and consistency across Europe," Rowland said. Rowland highlighted the significant potential of blockchain technologies: "We can see the many areas where the blockchain has significant potential to bring about positive change, even transformation, in how we do things. Whether this be tokenisation of investment products or improvements in post-trade infrastructure and interoperability, there are important positive stories to tell." The Central Bank aims to strike a balance between innovation and risk management. "It is important that these benefits can be realised, whilst also ensuring that the risks are well understood and managed." Rowland also noted the key role of regulation: "Regulation plays a crucial role in the safe, and therefore enduring, adoption of innovation into the system."

"Talking about regulations in this industry is good, as governments are getting ready for mass-adoption. The problem is, how will these regulations hinder development, and most importantly, deployment," says Daniel Logvin, CEO at LedgerByte. "Compliance is a very tough thing to achieve, especially when lots already have systems that work," Logvin adds. "It provides increased regulatory clarity, which will help support institutional trust, investor confidence and consumer protection," notes Susana Esteban, Managing Director at FTI Consulting. However, she cautions that "It adds more compliance responsibilities (and potentially costs) for crypto companies and traditional financial entities working with digital assets." Ireland's Potential As A Crypto Hub According to an October 2023 article by Ben Strack in Blockworks, Ireland's appeal to crypto companies has been growing for years. The Irish government launched an "Innovation Hub" in 2018, facilitating engagement between fintech firms and the Central Bank of Ireland. Coinbase opened its Dublin office in late 2018, while Gemini became the first Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Ireland in July 2022. MoonPay gained VASP status in August 2023, and Kraken received E-Money Institution authorization in September 2023. "We welcome regulatory clarity and continued improvement and enhancements by regulators to adapt regulations to both protect users and markets but also balancing out the need to continue to foster innovation and growth," says Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget. "Certainly Ireland is always high on the list for innovative companies to be based there as a global financial centre, its membership and access to the European Union as well as its favourable business environment including its deep talent pool. This certainly helps to encourage crypto-companies to consider Ireland more seriously as a base." "If Ireland pairs this with tax incentives or a business-friendly environment, it could become a hub for crypto firms, but this legislation is EU wide and it may have some competition for business," suggests Richard Lofthouse the Head of Risk and Data Science at InFlux Technologies. Balancing Regulation With Innovation In EU MiCAR regulates previously uncovered crypto-asset activities in the EU, including their issuance, custody, administration, and trading on platforms and exchanges. "This could position the EU as a leader in crypto regulation, but being a leader in rules doesn't always translate to success in the market. It's important for the EU to find a balance between strong regulation and allowing room for innovation to stay competitive globally," Logvin states. Esteban concludes, "Regulatory certainty can be a competitive advantage. MiCAR provides regulatory guidelines, which could make EU-based crypto businesses more attractive to institutional investors and partners, boosting their global credibility."

                    Institutional Interest Fuels Crypto Adoption in UAE
                </h3>

                            A surge in institutional interest is significantly advancing cryptocurrency adoption in the United Arab Emirates, positioning the region as a pivotal player in the global digital assets market. Major financial institutions, including banks and investment firms, are increasingly embracing blockchain technology and digital currencies, which is reshaping the traditional financial landscape. The UAE government has long fostered a progressive regulatory framework aimed at enhancing financial innovation, making it an attractive hub for crypto-related businesses. Initiatives like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) have introduced comprehensive regulations to streamline the process for businesses operating within the cryptocurrency sector. This regulatory clarity has encouraged a multitude of firms to set up operations in the UAE, ranging from exchanges to blockchain technology developers. Prominent players such as Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, have established a strong presence in the UAE, launching various initiatives aimed at bolstering local crypto education and investment. Binance’s strategy includes collaborations with universities and financial institutions to provide training programs on blockchain technology and digital currencies, further legitimizing the sector and drawing in more participants. Local banks are exploring partnerships with cryptocurrency firms, which is facilitating easier access to digital assets for institutional investors. For instance, Emirates NBD, one of the leading banks in the UAE, has initiated a pilot project allowing clients to access and trade cryptocurrencies. This move reflects a broader trend among banks to incorporate cryptocurrency services, ensuring their clients can leverage the potential of digital assets. Investment firms are also significantly contributing to the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the UAE. Institutional funds are being directed towards crypto assets, with firms recognizing the long-term potential of digital currencies as an asset class. The UAE’s favorable tax environment and progressive regulations make it an appealing destination for investment in cryptocurrencies. As a result, numerous venture capital firms have been established to fund blockchain and crypto-related startups, driving innovation and growth in the sector. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is another key trend contributing to the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the UAE. These platforms offer traditional financial services, such as lending and borrowing, without the need for intermediaries. As DeFi gains traction, more investors and institutions are seeking exposure to these innovative financial solutions, further accelerating cryptocurrency adoption. A noteworthy development is the growing interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The Central Bank of the UAE has been actively exploring the issuance of a digital dirham, aiming to complement existing fiat currencies while enhancing the efficiency of payment systems. This exploration aligns with global trends, as central banks worldwide assess the implications of CBDCs on monetary policy and financial stability. The potential introduction of a digital dirham is anticipated to provide a significant boost to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as it may foster interoperability between traditional and digital currencies. Despite the momentum, challenges remain in the path of widespread adoption. Security concerns, regulatory uncertainties, and the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies can deter some institutional investors. However, the UAE’s proactive approach to regulation and education is addressing these issues head-on, fostering a secure environment for investors to engage with digital assets. The role of local universities in promoting blockchain education cannot be overstated. Institutions such as the University of Sharjah and Khalifa University have integrated blockchain courses into their curricula, equipping students with the necessary skills to thrive in this emerging field. This educational push is essential for cultivating a skilled workforce capable of driving innovation in the cryptocurrency sector. The UAE’s strategic geographical location serves as a gateway to the broader Middle Eastern and African markets, enhancing its appeal as a cryptocurrency hub. With many neighboring countries showing increasing interest in digital assets, the UAE is well-positioned to lead the region in this transformative sector. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise, the UAE’s status as a regional and global leader in the digital assets space is becoming increasingly evident. The combination of favorable regulations, institutional interest, and a commitment to education and innovation is creating a robust ecosystem for cryptocurrencies to flourish.

                    Ancient Bitcoin Whale Reactivates, Moves Bitcoin Mined A Month After $BTC Launch

                            Bitcoin whales, the individuals or entities enjoying life on top of the cryptocurrency realm's ranks, have become a major engagement driver in the industry as their movements and massive transactions are widely followed.The "ancient" whales are on a different, more respected level. These long-term BTC holders are not just recent, one-time-big-time buyers. They are the OGs – a term often used by crypto holders to describe early adopters – of the community, even with their mysterious nature.On Tuesday, news of an early BTC whale's movement stirred up the crypto space anew, as this particular whale moved his stash mined from way back 2009.The Reawakening of an OG WhaleLeading blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence was first to unveil the transactions of the whale Tuesday, revealing that the whale moved 5 Bitcoins held dormant for nearly 10 years.In the last three weeks, the whale has moved a total of 10 BTC to Kraken in three separate transfers, Arkham data showed. In the last decade, the value of the whale's Bitcoin treasury ballooned from $474,000 to over $80 million.The data further showed that the Bitcoins were mined in February and March 2009, just a month after the official launch of the world's first decentralized digital asset, and months after pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto first introduced the digital coin to the world.Before Tuesday's transfer, the coins were also moved several times between 2011 and 2014 before the whale wallet retreated to darkness.Crypto Users Ponder on 'Legend' Whale's ActivityAs was the case whenever dormant whale accounts reawaken, crypto users on X immediately gathered to discuss the ancient whale's transactions."Looks like old homie pulled some out for life," one user said, congratulating the BTC "legend" for the "secured win" as a result of holding his Bitcoin stash for over a decade.One user said it "blows your mind" to just think about how long the whale hodled and waited for his stash to grow in the millions, and another noted how the development "shows true conviction in $BTC."Stonie, the founder of Shieldfolio, also shared his thoughts on the transfer, pointing out how the whale "basically just gave away all his rare sats to Kraken." He accompanied his comment with a photo showing just how "rare" the Bitcoins were.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been challenging $65,000 since the weekend. As of writing, the top digital asset is trading at around $63,700 after it plunged at one point in the last 24 hours to $62,800. Despite the plunge, it has been up by over 5% in the past week, as per CoinGecko, and is expected to trigger the next bull run if it retains the green line through the end of the month.

                    Cryptocurrency platform boss urges tighter regulation
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            The co-founder of one of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies called for tighter regulation of the sector to guard against the fraud and wild swings that have dogged it, in an interview with AFP.Jeremy Allaire of Circle recounted the US firm's decision to offer a stabilised cryptocurrency -- and insisted crypto operators owed it to society to submit to safeguards just as other emerging sectors such as AI must."We have social objectives that we have to match against the technology," Allaire said during a visit this week to Circle's European headquarters in Paris.Circle offers a USDC "stablecoin", pegged to the dollar, as well as a euro-pegged variant, EURC.Currently, $35.5 billion worth of USDC are in circulation.As with other cryptocurrencies, transactions are recorded on a decentralised ledger, the blockchain, and not by a bank as is the case with traditional currencies.However, whereas the dollar value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin tends to fluctuate, often wildly, the creators of stablecoins actively target a stable value.In a world propelled by technological development, Allaire said, safeguards are vital for such activities."If I'm writing software to control a ballistic missile system, that should be regulated activity," said Allaire."If I'm writing a large language model and deploying that, and it has the potential to do very problematic things in society, there need to be rules that need to be assessed. Crypto is the same thing." Crypto fraud, ransomware Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.The best-known cyptocurrency, bitcoin, remains the currency of choice for paying on the dark web without leaving any trace.It is used for extorting funds via ransomware attacks, which block access to victims' computer systems and demand a ransom payment.According to a recent report by Chainanalysis, the first half of 2024 was marked by a decrease in illicit activities. However, over that period, $460 million was paid out for ransomware, a rise of two percent on a year earlier.Crypto exhanges operate through open-source software, Allaire noted."That helps with transparency, visibility, security, other things."But some have been "using the technology to do things outside of any kind of supervision", he conceded."You've seen fraud, abuse. You've seen people running off with money."When cryptocurrency emerged, "unregulated intermediaries" sprang up in the sector, he said."Of course, the risks they take... in many cases, have led to significant losses," Allaire said."But that's not an argument against the technology. That's an argument against humans. And it's an argument for better supervision." EU, US crypto regulations Regulators across the globe have taken note.Last year the European Parliament adopted an EU-wide framework for crypto asset markets, "MiCA" -- Markets in Crypto-Assets -- requiring mandatory approval for digital-asset service providers.In July, Circle announced it was the first "stablecoin" issuer to comply with this new regulation.Stablecoins are used to facilitate intra-crypto exchanges by investors without having to go through a bank.But they also give users access to a product pegged to the dollar without having a bank account in the United States, and allow cross-border payments or money transfers.In the United States too, greater regulation is on the agenda.US presidential candidate Kamala Harris was quoted as telling Bloomberg last week: "We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors."In May the US House of Representatives passed a legal framework designed to regulate the crypto market -- the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.Circle is meanwhile preparing to move its headquarters from Boston to New York City - "at the very top of the World Trade Center... the very heart of the dollar international system," says Allaire."That's in part symbolic. It's also who we are, what we're doing. We're building, hopefully, the world's leading digital dollar and upgrading to this new internet financial system."

                            The overall crypto chart showed more gains than losses on Wednesday, September 25. Bitcoin reflected a gain of 1.20 percent on Indian exchanges and a profit of 6.14 percent on international exchanges over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $64,380 (roughly Rs. 53.7 lakh) on international exchanges, as per CoinMarketCap. On Indian exchanges meanwhile, the asset was priced at $66,630 (roughly Rs. 55.6 lakh). Ether reflected minor losses of less than one percent on both national as well as international exchanges on Tuesday. As shown by Gadgets360's crypto price tracker, ETH is trading at $2,731 (roughly Rs. 2.28 lakh) on Indian platforms like CoinDCX. Internationally, ETH is valued at $2,631 (roughly Rs. 2.19 lakh). “The crypto market continues to rally. BTC remains bullish, but with over $10 billion (roughly Rs. 83,526 crore) in high-leveraged short positions at the $72,000 (roughly Rs. 60 lakh) liquidation level, we could see volatility and a possible rejection or pullback around that area. ETH and related tokens are performing well as ETH/BTC found strong trendline support, signaling further outperformance. Notably, the upcoming US GDP quarterly data release tomorrow is a key event to watch for the week,” the CoinDCX market desk told Gadgets360.How Hong Kong’s CBDC Roadmap Resembles RBI's Approach with eRupee Binance Coin, Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, Tron, and Avalanche registered gains on Wednesday alongside Bitcoin. Shiba Inu, Polkadot, Leo, Litecoin, Cronos, Cosmos, Polygon, Bitcoin SV, and Neo Coin also found their way onto the profit-making side of the crypto chart on Tuesday. The overall crypto market cap went up by 1.89 percent in the last 24 hours. With this, the valuation of the crypto sector has reached $2.26 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,88,76,616 crore), showed CoinMarketCap.What is Blockchain Sharding: Explained “The global shift towards monetary easing, especially with China joining other major economies in loosening policies to counter economic slowdown, is largely responsible for this upward momentum,” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin told Gadgets360. Solana and USD Coin joined ETH on the loss-making side of the crypto chart. Stellar, Zcash, Iota, Qtum, and Status also saw price dips. “With central banks in the US, EU, and China cutting interest rates, the crypto market is seeing significant inflows, both directly and through ETFs, driven by improved economic sentiment,” Edul Patel, CEO Of Mudrex told Gadgets360. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.

                            There are less than two months left before the November elections, and cryptocurrency voters are closely watching how the attitudes of candidates are changing, especially with an apparent turnaround from a significant number of Republicans.Stand With Crypto, a digital assets advocacy group backed by crypto exchange giant Coinbase, is tracking the political landscape's attitudes and statements regarding the industry. What is the current state of crypto support among 2024 candidates?An Apparent Shift Among Democratic SenatorsWith just weeks ahead of the elections, Stand With Crypto's rankings have reflected an apparent change among Democratic senatorial candidates, albeit still significantly disproportionate to the number of Republican senatorial runners who have an A (strongly supportive) rating.There are five senatorial candidates from the Democratic Party who have been given an A rating: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and Ron Wyden of Oregon.Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has a B (somewhat supportive) rating, senators Mark Kelly of Arizona, Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Jon Tester of Montana have a C (neutral) rating, and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was given a D (somewhat against). Most other senatorial candidates from the party got an F (strongly against).House Dems Moving to Catch Up with GOPIn the House of Representatives, there is a much more evident shift among Democratic members. Dozens of candidates have been given an A rating, including Representatives Wiley Nickel of North Carolina, Ritchie Torres of New York, Ro Khanna of California, and even former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.In contrast to the House Dems' ratings, a vast majority of Republicans running for House seats received an A rating, including GOP Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, French Hill of Arkansas, James Comer of Kentucky, and Mike Flood of Nebraska.As of early Wednesday, only 12 GOP senatorial candidates have either a B or pending rating, and three got an F, namely Matt Rosendale of Montana, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Nick LaLota of New York.The State of Crypto Scores in Key RacesStand With Crypto has also been monitoring the crypto views of the top two races in the country for November: presidential and vice presidential.The GOP's Donald Trump has an A rating, and so does his running mate J.D. Vance. By contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz have no rating as of early Wednesday. The advocacy group notes that there is not enough information to determine Kamala's score as she has only made one statement about the industry throughout her career, while Walz currently has "no stance on crypto."Stand With Crypto's Endorsed CandidatesThe digital assets advocacy organization has a page dedicated to 21 candidates it endorses (11 Republicans and 10 Democrats), the top candidate on its list being Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo., followed by Zach Nunn, R-Iowa.Caraveo has been vocally supportive of a regulatory framework that should provide clarity for the crypto industry. She also voted in favor of the FIT21 bill and a resolution that sought to overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) divisive SAB 121 bulletin that the crypto industry has opposed.Nunn, like Caraveo, voted in favor of the SAB 121 resolution. He has called out the SEC's "vendetta against cryptocurrency" and vowed to defend Iowans' freedom to use their digital assets.

                    Bitcoin soars to a one-month high amid central banks’ easing policies
                </h3>

                            Bitcoin prices have surged to their highest level since 26 August, propelled by an acceleration in the global central banks’ easing cycle. The largest cryptocurrency has soared 21% since the second week of September, with its price climbing from above $53,000 (€47,400) to more than $64,000 (€57,200) on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies rise amid global easing of liquidity Cryptocurrencies are among the high-risk assets that have experienced a significant rally amid central banks’ commitments to reduce interest rates. In September, the European Central Bank implemented its second rate cut of the year, followed by the US Federal Reserve’s substantial 0.5% reduction. On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China introduced a series of easing measures, including cuts to key lending rates and increased cash injections into the markets to bolster its economy. These looser liquidity conditions have fuelled a rally in the digital token markets, propelling Bitcoin prices to a one-month high. Historically, Bitcoin prices have tended to trend upwards during periods when the Fed’s monetary policy shifts to easing. During the 2020 pandemic, Bitcoin prices skyrocketed by 1,600%, reaching more than $64,000 in April 2021 from the previous year. This price surge was primarily driven by global central banks’ near-zero interest rate policies, which unleashed significant liquidity into the markets, alongside a Bitcoin frenzy in mining and trading activities. However, the crypto markets experienced a sharp decline from their peak in November 2021, when the Fed signalled its intention to tighten monetary policy. Consequently, Bitcoin plummeted by 78%, falling to just above $15,000 (€13,400) by November 2022. The 2024 surge 2024 has witnessed a resurgence of enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin rising 52%, Ethereum increasing by 12%, and many other digital tokens also experiencing price gains. Bitcoin continues to outperform in the digital token markets, driven by its growing acceptance among major institutions and regulators. Its price surged by 48% in February following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), just before the significant Bitcoin halving event in April. This event, which occurs approximately every four years, halves the reward for mining new blocks. Since March, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, lacking significant catalysts within the crypto market. However, it experienced a brief surge in July when US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addressed crypto advocates at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. The former President pledged to make the United States “the crypto capital of the planet and Bitcoin the superpower of the world”. Bitcoin’s potential for further gains is uncertain The weakening of fiat currency power, rampant inflation, and the loss of credit in banks have been key drivers behind the surge in Bitcoin prices. Many believe that decentralised transactions represent the future trend in business, despite ongoing regulatory challenges. According to crypto enthusiasts, the Bitcoin price rally is far from over. Activist investor and ARK CEO Cathie Wood stated at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in 2022 that Bitcoin could be worth more than $1.5m (€1.3m) per coin if institutions allocate 5% of their portfolios to it. She also expressed her belief that the price will exceed $1m (€890,000) before 2030 in an interview with the New Zealand Herald. Other analysts have predicted that Bitcoin’s price could reach between $100,000 and $150,000 this year, based on mathematical calculations of the halving cycles. However, the extreme price volatility poses significant risks for inexperienced investors, as speculative trading continues to be the primary driver in the cryptocurrency market due to a lack of fundamental support.

                            The government wants your money. It will beg, steal or borrow if necessary, but it wants your money any way it can get it. The government’s schemes to swindle, cheat, scam, and generally defraud taxpayers of their hard-earned dollars have run the gamut from wasteful pork barrel legislation, cronyism and graft to asset forfeiture, costly stimulus packages, and a national security complex that continues to undermine our freedoms while failing to making us any safer. Americans have also been made to pay through the nose for the government’s endless wars, subsidization of foreign nations, military empire, welfare state, roads to nowhere, bloated workforce, secret agencies, fusion centers, private prisons, biometric databases, invasive technologies, arsenal of weapons, and every other budgetary line item that is contributing to the fast-growing wealth of the corporate elite at the expense of those who are barely making ends meet—that is, we the taxpayers. This is what comes of those $1.2 trillion spending bills: someone’s got to foot the bill. Because the government’s voracious appetite for money, power and control has grown out of control, its agents have devised other means of funding its excesses and adding to its largesse through taxes disguised as fines, taxes disguised as fees, and taxes disguised as tolls, tickets and penalties. No matter how much money the government pulls in, it’s never enough (case in point: the endless stopgap funding deals and constant ratcheting up of the debt ceiling), so the government has to keep introducing new plans to empower its agents to seize Americans’ bank accounts. Make way for the digital dollar. Whether it’s the central bank digital currency favored by President Biden, or the cryptocurrency being hawked by former President Trump, the end result will still be a form of digital money that makes it easier to track, control and punish the citizenry. For instance, weeks before the Biden Administration made headlines with its support for a government-issued digital currency, the FBI and the Justice Department quietly moved ahead with plans for a cryptocurrency enforcement team (translation: digital money cops), a virtual asset exploitation unit tasked with investigating crypto crimes and seizing virtual assets, and a crypto czar to oversee it all. No surprises here, of course. This is how the government operates: by giving us tools to make our lives “easier” while, in the process, making it easier for the government to crack down. Inevitably, a digital currency will become a central part of the government’s surveillance efforts. As such, digital currency provides the government and its corporate partners with a mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient. This push for a digital currency dovetails with the government’s war on cash, which it has been subtly waging for some time now. Much like the war on drugs and the war on terror, this so-called “war on cash” has been sold to the public as a means of fighting terrorists, drug dealers, tax evaders and even COVID-19 germs. According to economist Steve Forbes, “The real reason for this war on cash—start with the big bills and then work your way down—is an ugly power grab by Big Government. People will have less privacy: Electronic commerce makes it easier for Big Brother to see what we’re doing, thereby making it simpler to bar activities it doesn’t like, such as purchasing salt, sugar, big bottles of soda and Big Macs.” This is how a cashless society—easily monitored, controlled, manipulated, weaponized and locked down—plays right into the hands of the government (and its corporate partners). Despite what we know about the government and its history of corruption, bumbling, fumbling and data breaches, not to mention how easily technology can be used against us, the shift to a cashless society is really not a hard sell for a society increasingly dependent on technology for the most mundane aspects of life. In much the same way that Americans have opted into government surveillance through the convenience of GPS devices and cell phones, digital cash—the means of paying with one’s debit card, credit card or cell phone—is becoming the de facto commerce of the American police state. So what’s really going on here? Despite all of the advantages that go along with living in a digital age—namely, convenience—it’s hard to imagine how a cashless world navigated by way of a digital wallet doesn’t signal the beginning of the end for what little privacy we have left and leave us vulnerable to the likes of government thieves, data hackers and an all-knowing, all-seeing Orwellian corpo-governmental state. First, we’re already witnessing how easy it will be for government agents to manipulate digital wallets for their own gain in order to track your movements, monitor your activities and communications, and ultimately shut you down. For example, civil asset forfeiture schemes are becoming even more profitable for police agencies thanks to devices that allow police to not only determine the balance of any magnetic-stripe card (i.e., debit, credit and gift cards) but also freeze and seize any funds on pre-paid money cards. In fact, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it does not violate the Fourth Amendment for police to scan or swipe your credit card. Expect those numbers to skyrocket once digital money cops show up in full force. Third, a digital currency will open Americans—and their bank accounts—up to even greater financial vulnerabilities from hackers and government agents alike. Bottom line: digital authoritarianism will redefine what it means to be free in almost every aspect of our lives. We have virtually no control over who accesses our private information, how it is stored, or how it is used. And in terms of our bargaining power over digital privacy rights, we have been reduced to a pitiful, unenviable position in which we can only hope and trust that those in power will treat our information with respect. At a minimum, we need stricter laws on data privacy and an Electronic Bill of Rights that protects “we the people” from predatory surveillance and data-mining business practices by the government and its corporate partners.

Newsletter sign up Newsletter The chance to make bank on crypto may not be worth the risks (Image credit: Sean Gladwell / Getty Images) By Becca Stanek, The Week US published 25 September 2024 Cryptocurrency, or crypto, has been making headlines for years. Now, it has even entered the 2024 presidential election. Surprisingly, "almost half of all corporate money contributed to this year's federal election campaigns — yes, nearly half — has come from crypto backers, according to a recent report from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen," said Bankrate. But beyond being part of a buzzy industry with apparently deep pockets, is crypto actually a good investment? Here is what to know about its potential risks and rewards.

Before we get into whether to invest in crypto, let's review what crypto actually is. Effectively, said NerdWallet, cryptocurrency "is a digital currency, such as Bitcoin, that is used as an alternative payment method or speculative investment," meaning an investor hopes to profit from a change in value when they go to sell. Typically, "cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology — a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers" and "are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation," said Investopedia. What are the upsides of investing in crypto? Depending on the type of investor you are and your tolerance for risk, crypto can offer upsides as an investment, including: It is a decentralized currency. For many, a major upside of crypto is that it is a "decentralized currency, meaning it's not regulated by a single government or central bank," said Credit Karma. In other words, "governments can't control [crypto] like they can with centralized fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar." It offers diversification. One potential benefit of crypto for your portfolio is that owning some "can increase your portfolio's diversification since cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have historically shown few price correlations with the U.S. stock market," said The Motley Fool. Diversification is key when investing, as it spreads your portfolio across a number of different types of assets, buffering against market volatility. It may provide sizable returns. Though it is far from guaranteed this will happen, "several cryptocurrencies have seen their prices skyrocket since first being introduced," said Bankrate. This translates to "the potential for large gains on your investment." Are there risks or drawbacks to crypto? While past tales of people making bank on crypto may seem tempting, it is important to heavily weigh the downsides of this investment as well: It is extremely volatile. While risk of loss is possible with any type of investment," crypto's elevated volatility makes it an even bigger risk factor," said Forbes. As just one example, "Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later," said Investopedia. Further, said Bankrate, since cryptocurrencies "aren't backed by anything," that means "the price they trade at is determined by the whims of traders." It is susceptible to hacks and scams. Fraud and hacks are both common with crypto. That is because "though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked," said Investopedia. In the past, many exchanges and wallets have been hacked, "sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins." Plus, said Bankrate, "it is often difficult to recover stolen funds." It lacks government regulation. While some may see it as an upside that crypto is largely unregulated, that can bring some downsides as well. "Governments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways," said NerdWallet. It has a major environmental impact. Crypto is often made through mining, which "involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain," said Credit Karma. This "requires lots of computational power, which in turn requires a large amount of energy." In fact, according to "a comparison by the University of Cambridge," said NerdWallet, "worldwide Bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all U.S. residential lighting."

                    Crypto CEO and Bankman-Fried ex Caroline Ellison gets two-year sentence

                            NEW YORK (AFP) – Caroline Ellison, who testified against her former boyfriend and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried at his crypto fraud trial, was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison for her role in the case, New York prosecutors told AFP. Ellison, the former CEO of cryptocurrency firm Alameda Research, received a much lighter sentence than the maximum 110 years she faced after pleading guilty to seven charges, including fraud. Her defense team had argued against prison time. Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said they had not requested Judge Lewis Kaplan issue a specific sentence, instead simply suggesting he take her earlier cooperation into account. Ellison served as a key witness in the trial of cryptocurrency superstar Bankman-Fried — known by his initials “SBF” – who was sentenced to 25 years in March for one of the largest financial fraud cases in history. He is serving his sentence in prison and has appealed his conviction. During her court testimony, Ellison accused Bankman-Fried of dipping into customers’ funds to drive his more risky projects. He countered by attempting to pin the blame on Ellison, describing her as a bad manager. A billionaire before he turned 30, Bankman-Fried had been a poster boy for the cryptocurrency boom. Within the span of a few months, he had turned his small start-up FTX, first launched in 2019, into the world’s second largest cryptocurrency trading platform. However, as exposed by the Bankman-Fried trial, the company had used the assets deposited into FTX to perform riskier transactions via sister company Alameda Research, as well as purchase real estate and make political donations. FTX imploded in November 2022, reporting more than USD8 billion in debt by the time the company filed for bankruptcy.

                            Caroline Ellison, who testified against her former boyfriend and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried at his crypto fraud trial, was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison for her role in the case, New York prosecutors told AFP.Ellison, the former CEO of cryptocurrency firm Alameda Research, received a much lighter sentence than the maximum 110 years she faced after pleading guilty to seven charges, including fraud.Her defense team had argued against prison time. Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said they had not requested Judge Lewis Kaplan issue a specific sentence, instead simply suggesting he take her earlier cooperation into account.Ellison served as a key witness in the trial of cryptocurrency superstar Bankman-Fried -- known by his initials "SBF" -- who was sentenced to 25 years in March for one of the largest financial fraud cases in history.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement("script");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, "//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js");He is serving his sentence in prison and has appealed his conviction.During her court testimony, Ellison accused Bankman-Fried of dipping into customers' funds to drive his more risky projects. He countered by attempting to pin the blame on Ellison, describing her as a bad manager.A billionaire before he turned 30, Bankman-Fried had been a poster boy for the cryptocurrency boom.Within the span of a few months, he had turned his small start-up FTX, first launched in 2019, into the world's second largest cryptocurrency trading platform.However, as exposed by the Bankman-Fried trial, the company had used the assets deposited into FTX to perform riskier transactions via sister company Alameda Research, as well as purchase real estate and make political donations.FTX imploded in November 2022, reporting more than $8 billion in debt by the time the company filed for bankruptcy.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

                    Will the US presidential election define the future of crypto?

                            The clampdown on cryptocurrencies in the US this year has been mirrored in Europe. In April, the European Union agreed new laws to try to reduce the risk of crypto being used by criminals. However, other regulators are being slower to act. The G20 group of leading economies is working on minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, but they are not legally binding, and uptake has been slow. Back in the US, a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been passed by the House, but not the Senate. Its critics argue it will give less protection to consumers. Coinbase’s Mr Grewal backs the bill, and says: “This is not an industry that is shying away from regulation.” He adds that the sector just wants the same standards applied to crypto as are applied to other assets, “no tougher, but no weaker”.
