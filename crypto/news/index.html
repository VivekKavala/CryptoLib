                    Crypto Sentiment Climbs as Fear & Greed Index Returns to Greed
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The crypto market sentiment has shifted into “Greed” territory, following weeks of fluctuating investor confidence. The widely-followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges market emotions by analyzing various factors like volatility, trading volume, and social media trends, has seen a significant rise, surpassing the fear levels that dominated the market throughout August. The return to “Greed” reflects a growing optimism among investors, particularly as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies witness a resurgence in both interest and price stability. August proved to be a challenging month for crypto investors, as the Fear & Greed Index repeatedly fell into “Fear” territory, even touching its lowest point this year. However, as September progressed, market sentiment began to recover, buoyed by factors such as improved macroeconomic conditions and positive technical indicators in the crypto space. By the end of the month, the index reached the 60s range, signaling an influx of confidence. Bitcoin’s relative stability near the $27,000 mark played a key role in this renewed optimism. Despite the market’s cautious optimism, analysts continue to advise investors to remain vigilant. Historical data shows that periods of “Greed” can sometimes precede a correction, as heightened confidence may lead to overbought conditions in the market. Bitcoin’s surge has also been accompanied by growing altcoin activity, leading to speculations about an upcoming altcoin season, where smaller cryptocurrencies may outperform the market leader.

                    Meet Australia's next astronaut, who scored a ticket to space thanks to a crypto entrepreneur

                            Eric Philips remembers the day he watched in awe as humans first set foot on the Moon in 1969. "I sat in the gymnasium of my primary school with the entire school … looking at a tiny little screen [showing] the Apollo astronauts landing on the Moon," the 62-year-old recalled. "And I was captivated ever since." More than five decades on, the Australian explorer is about to embark on his own history-making space adventure. In December, he and three other amateur astronauts are scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on the first-ever human spaceflight to orbit the Earth's polar regions. Once it happens, Mr Philips will become the fourth Australian in space. He'll also be the first Australian to fly on a SpaceX mission. "Here I am kind of reliving that childhood dream." Space mission funded by crypto entrepreneur By his own account, his ticket to space is "the most bizarre opportunity". Mr Philips runs an adventure company that takes clients on ski expeditions to Antarctica and the Arctic. Loading... Two years ago, during an expedition in the Arctic, one of his clients started chatting about space travel. "We talked about what it would be like to fly to the Moon and to Mars," Mr Philips said. "And apparently, I started singing, 'Fly Me to the Moon'. "I think that's what captured his attention for me in particularly." The client was Chun Wang, a wealthy Maltese cryptocurrency entrepreneur. A year after that conversation, Mr Philips received a text message from Mr Wang. "And sort of jokingly, I think I sent him a 'hands up' emoji, and said, 'Well, look, you know, I'm interested'. "Little did I know that I would be the chosen one." 'Earth will be whizzing past us' The mission has been dubbed "Fram2". The name refers to the historic polar vessel Fram, which was used in expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic regions in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Fram2 involves a four-person crew orbiting the planet in SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The team is expected to launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in the second-half of December. "It's quite incredible," Mr Philips said. Mr Wang, who will be mission commander, has funded the trip, although the cost has not been disclosed. Mr Philips, who lives in Victoria, after two decades spent in Tasmania, will act as a mission specialist and medic. The other two members of the crew are Norwegian vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen and German co-pilot Rabea Rogge. The group will spend three to five days in space in a low Earth orbit, hurtling from the north pole to the south pole approximately every 45 minutes. "We are able to open the nose cone of the Dragon capsule, and then we have a cupola — a large glass dome — which is specifically there for viewing Earth and the cosmos around us." First human X-ray in space Fram2 isn't just an expensive sightseeing tour. The team will be conducting a range of scientific experiments and observations while in orbit. According to a SpaceX announcement last month: "[Mr] Wang aims to use the mission to highlight the crew's explorational spirit, bring a sense of wonder and curiosity to the larger public, and highlight how technology can help push the boundaries of exploration of Earth and through the mission's research." As the capsule passes over the polar regions, those on board will be capturing images and vision of "unusual light emissions resembling auroras". "The crew will study green fragments and mauve ribbons of continuous emissions comparable to the phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), which has been measured at an altitude of approximately 400 to 500 kilometres above Earth's atmosphere," SpaceX said. The crew will also test the effects of space flight on the human body, including capturing the first human-X-ray images in space. "All of which will help in the development of tools needed to prepare humanity for future long-duration space flight," SpaceX said. Mr Philips said further details about their in-flight research would be outlined prior to the trip. "We're going to be very excited to be able to reveal what they are in the coming months." 'Mind-blowingly exciting' adventure awaits SpaceX's Dragon capsule is an autonomous vehicle, meaning there's little those on board will have to do from launch to splash down. But they have still had to undergo stringent medical testing and centrifuge training to ensure they can handle the mission. "I was pretty concerned about that, because I do get chronically motion sick, and that happens every time I get on a ship or a boat to Antarctica," Mr Philips said. "But I performed flawlessly, thankfully, because there's actually no correlation between motion sickness and space sickness." The team has also spent several weeks doing simulated training in a capsule to prepare for potential emergencies. "Nothing can be controlled 100 per cent as much as we like them to be," Mr Philips said. "We just kind of need to deal with those situations if they arise, but it's unlikely they will." For now, Mr Philips is simply focused on the extraordinary adventure that awaits. "The whole thing is mind-blowingly exciting." Fram2 will be SpaceX's thirteenth human space flight, and the sixth commercial mission involving the Dragon capsule. Loading...

                            Vazhdon afrimi i gjigantit të pagesave PayPal drejt botës së aseteve dixhitale vazhdon. Në fakt, kohët e fundit ajo njoftoi se ka integruar funksionalitetin e kriptove për llogaritë e biznesit në Shtetet e Bashkuara. Në praktikë, tregtarët amerikanë do të jenë në gjendje të kryejnë shitjet, blerjet dhe transferimet e kriptomonedhave. Lajm i mirë për tregtarët që tani kanë mundësi shtesë pagese për t’u ofruar klientëve të tyre. Pasi hapëm dyert në botën e kriptomonedhave për klientët, tani kemi mbërritur te tregtarët. Ne ende e mbajmë mend kur PayPal prezantoi kriptomonedhën e tij të plotë BitLicense. Megjithatë, ky shërbim nuk do të jetë i disponueshëm për bizneset brenda shtetit të Nju Jorkut për momentin. Ky është kufiri i vetëm i shpallur nga nënpresidenti Jose Fernandez da Ponte. Një e metë e vogël që nuk errëson zgjerimin e këtij shërbimi drejt tregut të kriptomonedhave dhe aseteve dixhitale. PayPal ofron funksione kripto për bizneset Lajm i mirë për kompanitë amerikane që tani kanë veçori të reja kripto për t’u ofruar klientëve të tyre dhe për t’i shfrytëzuar personalisht. Një hapje e mëtejshme drejt kriptomonedhave është ajo e PayPal e cila pranoi se sa e nevojshme ishte prezantimi i kësaj risi për kompanitë: Pronarët e bizneseve – shpjegoi Jose Fernandez da Ponte – kanë shprehur gjithnjë e më shumë dëshirën për të pasur të njëjtat aftësi të kriptomonedhave në dispozicion të konsumatorëve. Ne jemi të ngazëllyer për të përmbushur këtë kërkesë duke ofruar këtë ofertë të re, duke i lejuar ata të ndërveprojnë me monedhat dixhitale pa mundim. Kësaj i shtohet edhe mundësia e transferimit të jashtëm të kriptomonedhës në zinxhir në kuletat e përshtatshme të palëve të treta. Kushdo që ka një llogari biznesi PayPal do të jetë në gjendje të dërgojë dhe të marrë argumente të mbështetura të kriptomonedhave drejt dhe nga çdo adresë e jashtme blockchain. Në përgjithësi, një arritje e madhe. Miliona tregtarë në të gjithë SHBA-në do të jenë në gjendje të përfitojnë nga kjo veçori e re e integruar në portofolin e tyre të biznesit. Aktualisht ne ende nuk e dimë se kur e gjithë kjo do të bëhet e disponueshme për tregtarët në shtetin e Nju Jorkut dhe do të shtrihet edhe në vende të tjera. Dy platforma të sigurta ku ju mund të bëni investimet tuaja në kriptomonedha janë Binance dhe cex.io. Këto dy platforma pranojnë pagesa edhe nga Shqipëria, Kosova dhe Maqedonia e Veriut. /zero1

                            The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged cryptocurrency trading platform Mango Markets with unregistered sales of its digital asset token, which the regulator identified as a security. The SEC also settled charges against Mango Labs and Blockworks Foundation for failing to register as brokers, the agency said. Jurors in federal court in Manhattan earlier this year convicted a crypto trader of commodities fraud for rigging the Mango Markets exchange and stealing about $110 million from the platform.

                    At Least $5 Million Lost to ATM Bitcoin Fraud in San Diego in 2023: Reports
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Automated teller machines for Bitcoin, the latest innovation appropriated by fraudsters to get money out of the hands of victims and into their own, are increasingly showing up in San Diego County. One Bitcoin website identified 17 locations around the county for its machines, from Alpine to Tijuana to Encinitas. The way it works is as follows: Customers insert cash or a debit card into the ATM to exchange traditional currency for bitcoin currency. Only identification is needed to access the machines. Victims, many of whom are seniors, are instructed to change the money and then send the bitcoin currency to an encrypted address. Not long after that, the money is moved quickly across the county or around the globe. The machines can be found anywhere that traditional ATMs can be found. The multiple locations are easy conduits for fraudulent withdrawals. San Diego’s Elder Justice Task Force — a collaboration between the DA’s office, FBI, APS, local law enforcement, and the US Attorney’s Office — reports that in 2023, victims in San Diego County alone lost a total of more than $5,000,000 to fraud by placing money into the machines. Nationally, the FBI reports that in 2023, more than 12,000 victims aged 60 and older indicated that cryptocurrency was a medium or tool used to facilitate the scam or fraud that targeted them. At a U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal discussed a letter he and other senators had written to large Bitcoin ATM operators on their failures to prevent elder scams. Several witnesses testified that the problem is rampant and needs to be addressed immediately. Among those speaking was San Diego Deputy District Attorney Scott Pirrello, who was invited because of his breadth of experience with the many types of elder abuse fraud. Pirrello, who heads Elder Abuse Prosecutions within the DA’s office, told the senators on the panel that a victim in Escondido who withdrew $15,000 from her bank went into a liquor store in a dangerous part of town in the middle of the night. That’s how convincing these con men are in motivating victims to act, and how so much is being stolen, Pirello said. Pirrello added that in San Diego and around the country, there’s frustration growing within law enforcement. “We have a victim that runs to the police station and says, I just put $10,000 into this machine, and my money is sitting right there in that machine. Can you get it back for me? And so far, there is an inability to do that because of the nuance of how these cryptocurrency transactions work.” “The window is so tight for there to be any intervention, and so there should be as many safeguards as possible to prevent these victims from putting their money in these machines in the first place,” he said, noting that it took just twelve minutes to send the Escondido victim’s money to southeast Asia, outside U.S. jurisdiction. The lies take many forms, but right now tech and personal information scams top the list, according to data collected by the FBI. The scams take advantage of the lack of familiarity by older citizens with computers and cybersecurity issues. For example, a pop-up message might appear, falsely warning that a device is damaged or needs fixing, or that a bank account needs immediate attention. When the victim calls or emails for “support” help, the scammer often requests remote access to the their computer. And more and more often, the senior ends up taking a trip to a local bitcoin ATM , which is the address provided by the scammer. Kathy Stokes with AARP Fraud Watch, who also testified before the committee, estimates that multiple millions of dollars are being stolen and routed through the ATMs. The victims “go to their bank, take out tens of thousands of dollars in cash, then telling them where to go to find the crypto machine, and then them standing there and putting $100 at a time into these machines, and coaching them on how to get that money to the electronic wallet.” The victim “thinks that this is going to solve a problem,” not realizing they “just created all that much more,” she says. Virtually nothing is being done by the companies themselves to try to forestall these frauds, witnesses said. Pirrello added that some of the ATM companies are being responsible in the sense that they will submit suspicious activity reports — but well after that victim’s money is unrecoverable. He and Stokes called for more and better regulation, clearer warnings about the risks inherent in anonymous systems such as Bitcoin, and legislation targeting scams such as these. SB 401, which goes into effect in 2025, creates a transaction limit of $1,000 a day per customer per machine. But Pirello says his office is already seeing cases where victims are being instructed to move from machine to machine to overcome this transaction limit. Regulation may not be enough to curb the fraud. In March 2022, all Bitcoin machines in the UK were declared illegal. Authorities there warn people that using the machines may lead to the loss of all their money.

                    Vampire Survivors dev opens publishing arm, tells Web3 and F2P mobile games to stuff it
                </h3>

                            Vampire Survivors developer Poncle is branching out from making videogames that are pure sugar in digital form. It's getting businessy, and has announced that it's opening a new publishing division, presumably to help other devs consume hours, days, months of our time with the most absurdly moreish games ever made. According to GI.biz, Poncle's team was speaking at Game Republic's Pitching to Investors and Publishers event in Liverpool on Wednesday when it announced its big plans to bankroll other people's game dev dreams. Specifically, it said it wasn't going to be a "traditional publisher," which is entirely believable for the company whose recent patch notes just consisted of increasingly unhinged scrawls of "Bug fixes and improvements" in different-sized fonts. Of course, every capitalist on Earth wants to make their endeavours sound like they come from a place of love, but I'm inclined to believe Poncle on this one. It says it wants to act pretty much as a piggy bank to help others "make their games," and is offering stuff like funding, help with platforms, localisation, QA, and all the other stuff you generally expect from, you know, a publisher. "We want to sign everything!" said the team, "But we're very smol!" Except, actually, it doesn't want to sign everything. There are standards to maintain around here, you know, and that means Poncle has a list of "insta-nos": stuff it's not gonna support no matter how much you twist its arm. What's on it? AI and Web3 nonsense, free-to-play mobile games, and anything "Survivor-like." The first two are self-explanatory: AI and Web3 (that means crypto-stuff, NFTs, and what-have-you) as fields aren't popular with devs or players, and are widely regarded as tech-broey, grasping incursions into our pure and holy gaming space. Free-to-play mobile games have much of the same whiff about them. Sure, there are some that are genuinely good, but a profusion of asset-flips and minimum-effort cash grabs has cast a pall on the whole scene. But I'm curious how strict that "Survivor-like" policy is. Vampire Survivors-esque games have become a bit of their own genre since the original hit it big, and some of them are great. Perhaps Poncle just doesn't want a conflict of interest—funding a direct competitor to its own game—but I'm curious how strict that policy is. I've reached out to the studio to find out, and I'll update this piece if I hear back.

                    How Much is 1BTC to Naira Today? Check Real-Time Rates and Maximise Your Profit
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Bitcoin has always been the talk of the financial world for one primary reason—its volatility. One minute, you could be sitting on massive gains; the next, the market dips, and you wonder if you should have sold sooner. For traders and investors in Nigeria, this rollercoaster makes checking Bitcoin’s price in Naira (NGN) critical. Why? Because, with the ever-fluctuating BTC to Naira rates, making profitable trades requires precision and perfect timing. Knowing the real-time value of Bitcoin not only helps you secure the best deals but also gives you a leg up in an increasingly competitive market. With the right tools and strategies, you can ensure you’re getting the maximum profit when converting Bitcoin to Naira. Here’s how you can do it. Understanding BTC to Naira Exchange Rate What Affects Bitcoin’s Price in Naira? Bitcoin’s price is anything but stable, and several factors affect how much 1BTC to Naira is worth: Global Demand and Supply of Bitcoin: Like any asset, Bitcoin’s price is driven by how much people want to buy or sell it. When demand spikes, so does the price, and vice versa. Influence of the USD/NGN Exchange Rate: The Naira’s value against the US Dollar plays a significant role in determining BTC to Naira conversions. Since Bitcoin is typically priced in USD globally, fluctuations in the USD/NGN exchange rate directly impact the local price of Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Global crypto market trends, including institutional investments, regulatory developments, and social media hype, can cause sudden price surges or crashes. Government Policies on Crypto in Nigeria: While Nigeria has shown resistance toward crypto adoption, policies regulating or restricting crypto activities can affect the price locally. Restrictions can cause price disparities between Nigeria and the global market. Why the Price Varies Between Platforms Have you ever noticed that the BTC to NGN rate differs across platforms? Here’s why: Liquidity: Some platforms have higher liquidity, meaning more Bitcoin is traded there, allowing them to offer better prices. Smaller exchanges with lower trade volumes often have less competitive rates. Fees and Spreads: Each platform sets its own fee structure. While some might advertise great rates, hidden fees or wide spreads between the buy and sell prices can eat into your profit. Local vs. International Platforms: International exchanges might offer rates closer to global averages, while local exchanges often adjust prices based on local demand and liquidity, leading to price differences. Real-Time BTC to Naira Rates: How to Check Them Top Platforms Offering Real-Time BTC to Naira Conversion Rates To ensure you get the most accurate and up-to-date BTC to Naira exchange rate, you need to use a reliable platform like Breet. Breet stands out for offering real-time rates that can be trusted. By using Breet’s built-in calculator, you can avoid unnecessary surprises in your transactions. Maximise Your Profit When Converting BTC to Naira 1. Timing Your Sale: When to Convert for Maximum Profit Timing is everything when you want to sell bitcoin in Nigeria. To maximise your profit: Monitor market trends and price spikes: Watch for upward price movements and sell when the market is peaking. Conversely, avoid selling in a downturn unless it’s absolutely necessary. Avoid panic selling: If you see the market dipping, take a moment before making any hasty decisions. Panic selling often leads to regret, especially in such a volatile market. Best times to sell: While no one can predict the market with certainty, many traders find the most favourable rates during higher trading volumes, often on weekday mornings. 2. Choosing the Right Platform for Selling BTC When selecting a platform for selling Bitcoin in Nigeria, Breet is one of the top choices. Here’s why: No Transaction Fees: One of the biggest advantages of Breet is that it doesn’t charge transaction fees, allowing you to keep more of your earnings. Every Satoshi counts! Easy and Instant Transactions: Breet allows you to sell Bitcoin and receive your Naira instantly. You won’t have to wait more than a few minutes for your cash. 3. Minimising Fees and Maximising Returns Platforms like Breet help you maximise your returns by cutting out the typical fees on other exchanges. Whether you’re a frequent trader or a one-time seller, using a no-fee platform is a huge advantage. Remember, saving on fees is as good as earning extra on your trade. Conclusion Maximising your profit when converting Bitcoin to Naira is about being strategic. Always: Check real-time rates before selling to ensure you’re getting the best deal. Choose the right platform, like Breet, to avoid unnecessary fees and secure the highest returns. Time your sale for when market trends favour you, and stay informed using reliable tools to track Bitcoin rates. By staying on top of the market and making informed decisions, you can boost your profits significantly. Ready to start? Head over to Breet and check today’s real-time BTC to Naira rates!

                            УИХ-ын чуулганаар “Төрөөс мөнгөний бодлогын талаар 2023 онд баримтлах үндсэн чиглэл батлах тухай” Улсын Их Хурлын тогтоолын төслийг хэлэлцэв. Энэ үеэр УИХ-ын гишүүн Ч.Ундрам ипотекийн зээлтэй холбоотой асуулт асуулаа. Тэрбээр “Дотооддоо хүнсээ үйлдвэрлэх гэсэн ч банкууд зээл гаргахгүй байна. Энэ асуудал дээр ямар арга хэмжээ авах вэ? Өмнөх жил ипотекийн зээлийн хэмжээ, барилгын үнийн талаар асууж байсан. Тэгэхэд та орон сууцны үнийн өсөлт хэвийн байгаа. Цаашид ч хэвийн буюу Монголбанк хянана гэж хариулсан. Энэ жил орон сууцны үнэ 19 хувиар өссөн. Төлбөрийн тэнцлийн алдагдлыг бий болгоход барилгын салбар хамгийн ихээр нөлөөлж байна. Түүний асуултад Монголбанкны ерөнхийлөгч Б.Лхагвасүрэн “Хүнсний ногооны тариалан эрхлэгчдэд зээл олгосон. Газар тариалан эрхлэгчдэд 790 тэрбум төгрөгийн зээл олгоод байна. Өмнөх онд үл хөдлөх хөрөнгийн үнэ 17 хувиар, энэ онд 19 хувиар өссөн байна. Үнэ өсөхөд өртөг зардал, ялангуяа барилгын материалын үнэ өсөж байгаа нь үл хөдлөх хөрөнгийн үнэд нөлөөлж байна. Монголбанк ипотекийн зээлийг ирэх оноос зогсоох гэж байгаа. Яагаад гэвэл энэхүү зээлийг Цар тахлын хуулийн дагуу олгож байгаа юм. Олгож байгаа эх үүсвэрийн хувьд эргэн төлөлтөөс санхүүждэг. Энэ хөтөлбөр өөрөө өөрийгөө санхүүжүүлэх хэмжээнд очсон. Энэ утгаараа 2023 оноос Монголбанк хуулийн дагуу ипотекийн зээлийг олгож болохгүй. Тэгэхээр Засгийн газрын нэг агентлаг, аж ахуйн нэгжээр дамжаад энэ хөтөлбөр цаашид хэрэгжих боломжтой гэж харж байна” гэж хариуллаа.

                    Bitcoin Hits $65K – Why Is $BTC Up Today?

                            Bitcoin has finally broken the $65,000-line after days of struggling between $63,000 and $64,000. The world's first decentralized cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend in recent weeks, but on a slower pace compared to its speedy surges earlier this year.As of early Friday, BTC is trading at around $65,300, data from CoinGecko shows. The digital coin has seen a 3% increase in the last 24 hours and has been surging by over 2% in the past week. Why is Bitcoin up today?Cryptocurrencies are, by nature, volatile. Various aspects around the financial and geopolitical landscape affect the digital assets, but Friday's $BTC spike can be attributed to three factors.Spot $BTC ETFs Log Huge Inflow DayThursday was a big day for U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds collectively hauled in $365.7 million, led by Ark/21 Shares' ARKB ($113.8 million), BlackRock's IBIT ($93.4 million), and Fidelity's FBTC ($74 million), as per data from Farside Investors.The data from Thursday marks the sixth consecutive day of positive inflows in U.S. spot BTC ETFs, triggering optimistic views about the digital currency and driving expectations about Bitcoin finally erasing its often bitter history with the month of September.$BTC Users Look Forward to 'Uptober'Historically, the fourth quarter of the year has been relatively good to the world's top digital currency by market value. For instance, last year, Bitcoin started October at $27,900 and wrapped up the month at $34,600, as per Yahoo Finance data. It ended the year at $42,200.Crypto executive EljaBoom said Wednesday that BTC's "parabolic phase has started," so users should expect an "Uptober," followed by a "Moonvember," a "Pumpcember," and a "Bulluary" to kick off 2025.Gary Gensler Affirms Bitcoin's Legal StatusAlso on Thursday, the Bitcoin community was in an upbeat mood after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler affirmed in an interview that BTC is not a security.While many Bitcoiners have already been sure from the start that BTC is a commodity, Gensler's affirmation brought excitement and renewed trust among smaller Bitcoin holders who may have started losing faith due to the SEC's enforcement-first approach toward digital assets.Harris-Walz Economic Playbook Mentions Digital AssetsPossibly lingering through Friday was the impact of the economic plan published by the Harris-Walz campaign, which mentioned digital assets, albeit just once throughout the 80-page playbook.Some prominent figures in the crypto space welcomed Vice President Kamala Harris's seemingly softer stance on the industry, considering how the Biden administration was not as friendly to the sector.Bitcoin has been on a wild ride in recent months, but it wavered multiple headwinds throughout the second quarter, including the massive German government dump and two crypto market bloodbaths in August.

                            Memecoins based on political figures are wildly surging as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris's lead on Polymarket early Friday, with multiple Trump-themed tokens commanding two-digit leads going into the weekend.Data from decentralized market prediction platform Polymarket shows that Trump is now just 1 percentage point away from tying his Democratic foe (49% to 50%), marking a stark contrast from last week's numbers, when the vice president led the business mogul by 5 points (52% to 47%).Figures in Battleground States MoveAlso, last week, Harris took four of six swing states being monitored by Polymarket: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. At the time, the former prosecutor had a significant four-point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania. Figures in the Keystone State are particularly crucial since the state is considered the most critical for the warring parties in this year's elections.Harris is still ahead in the abovementioned four states. However, as of Friday, some of the numbers have started to flip. In Pennsylvania, Harris is in the lead at 51% over Trump's 49%.In Wisconsin, Trump added 4% from last week, even if he remains behind the Democratic presidential nominee. On the other hand, Harris widened her lead further in Michigan at 66% to 34% compared to last week's 60% to 40%.Polymarket numbers aren't the only figures changing. Activity around political finance (PolitiFi) memecoins have been spiking in recent days with less than six weeks left before the November elections.$KAMA Leads PolitiFi Memecoins SurgeHarris-based Kamala Horris (KAMA) is leading the political memecoins spike, surging by nearly 49% in the last 24 hours following a week-long rally of 76.7% as per data from CoinGecko.Tooker Kurlson (TOOKER), the token based off of political commentator Tucker Carlson, is in second place in terms of daily gains in the top ranks of the world's largest PolitiFi memecoins by market value. TOOKER has increased by 32.5% in the last day.Coming in third is Trump-based MAGA (TRUMP), which saw a 27.1% surge in the past day. It has been on a 66% increase in the last seven days and remains the world's second-largest PolitiFi memecoin by market cap.Another Trump-themed token, Doland Tremp (TREMP), was also surging overnight, increasing by 25.5% amid a 44.4% weeklong rally. Even Joe Biden-based Jeo Boden (BODEN) pumped in the past week.Many other smaller politics-based tokens surged over the last 24 hours, including Barron Trump-themed Mini Donald (BARRON), which added over 18%, and MoonTrump (TRUMP), which increased by 12%.Americans are set to vote for a new president on Nov. 5. Crypto holders around the country are expected to join in, as crypto's recent inclusion in political discussions is deemed as a "defining moment" for the revolutionary industry.

                    Will Tether Finally Meet Its Rival? Robinhood Reportedly Explores Stablecoin Offering
                </h3>

                            Fintech titan Robinhood is exploring the possibility of entering the multi-billion-dollar stablecoin market, a new report revealed, signaling increasing interest in stablecoins as the broader cryptocurrency industry continues to grow.Robinhood is already working on possibly issuing its own stablecoin, but it has yet to make a final decision, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.The Menlo Park-based fintech services provider, who also has a crypto arm, Robinhood Crypto, reportedly dabbled into the possibility over hopes that stricter regulations on stablecoins in the European Union and other jurisdictions will give it an opportunity to challenge Tether's dominance in the space.The Burgeoning Stablecoins MarketAs of early Friday, the stablecoin market is nearing a staggering $174 billion market cap, data from CoinGecko shows. Trading volume has exceeded $80 billion.Tether's USDT takes up the majority of the market space, accounting for over $119.4 billion. In second place, USDC holds a market value of $36.3 billion. DAI, in third place, is even farther behind, with a market cap of $5.4 billion.How MiCA Could Turn the TidesThe European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which includes a comprehensive list of guidelines for crypto and digital asset service providers, is so far the most significant crypto-focused regulation worldwide.The stablecoin-specific regulations have come into effect, but even before MiCA's implementation kicked off this year, Tether already faced a setback.In March, crypto exchange OKX delisted its USDT pairs in Europe, with OKX customer support telling customers in the region that "modifications were essential for us to comply with regulations and uphold the security of our platform."It remains to be seen whether other exchanges will follow suit, but OKX is one of the Top 5 largest crypto exchanges in the world by trading volume, making the delisting a serious blow to USDT.Robinhood's Crypto VenturesMeanwhile, Robinhood is a major fintech player that has been in the financial space for more than a decade and has carefully observed the ups and downs of global markets. A Robinhood spokesperson clarified that the company has "no imminent plans to launch this offering" when asked by Bloomberg for a comment.The statement could mean that while there are no immediate plans to issue a Robinhood stablecoin, it could also mean that the fintech leader is not against the possibility.Also, the company continues to dabble into the crypto space. Outside Robinhood Crypto, the company may soon have its own digital assets exchange. In June, it announced that it had agreed to acquire Bitstamp in a $200 million cash deal. At the time, Robinhood said the acquisition "better positions" the company to "expand outside the U.S. and will bring a trusted a reputable institutional business" to the evolving fintech behemoth.

                    Crypto pre-sales: High risk or high rewards? A beginner’s guide to navigating early-stage token investments
                </h3>

                            The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the latest trend that has been gaining traction in 2024 is crypto pre-sales. These crypto pre-sales have especially become attractive for investors looking for early-stage opportunities. Crypto pre-sales entails tokens being sold before they hit public exchanges, and they both entail great potential on one hand and considerable risks on the other hand. So, for beginners, is it the right move to invest in these pre-sales? Crypto pre-sales explained To understand the opportunities and risks related to this investment opportunity, it is important to first understand the nature of crypto pre-sales. These are also known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and it refers to stages where new cryptocurrencies offer tokens to early investors at a discounted price. This usually can happen before the token is listed on public exchanges. There are several popular cryptocurrencies which started off with highly successful pre-sales, including Ethereum and Tezos, which raised millions and offered early investors substantial returns. Pros of investing in crypto pre-sales: High potentials and access The most attractive aspect of crypto pre-sales is the high potential for returns. Since investors gain access to tokens at a fraction of their future trading price, which can potentially result in high yields. One example of this happening is Ethereum. This currency raised $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and the price during the ICO was $0.311 with over 60 million Ether sold. In other words, it became the one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and has since been a key player in the realm of cryptocurrencies. There are new projects which continue to attract investors since they offer innovative solutions. These include AI-driven trading, decentralized Bitcoin mining, and tokens like BTC Bull Token which are directly linked to Bitcoin, which gives investors a chance to make significant profits if engaging early. The value will rise once the tokens are publicly traded. By offering investors a glimpse into cutting-edge crypto projects, these pre-sales have become a great way to access innovative projects. Pre-sales allow investors to support novel and creative solutions in their earliest stages, as these projects often incorporate emerging technologies and trends. This makes investing in them appealing to any investors who is driven by innovation. Discounted prices and community building Another great pro of investing in crypto pre-sales is the discounted prices these tokens are offered at. In other words, investors can secure these tokens cheaper than they otherwise would cost once they are publicly traded. Several projects have offered tokens in pre-sale for a steep discount, attracting interest from early investors. The benefit of the lower prices means that once the tokens go public and the demand grows, the value also rises, ultimately leading to high returns. Community driven marketing is at the core of pre-sales, which is fostering an ecosystem of community engagement. By engaging investors early, investors become a part of an ecosystem which consists of voting rights, staking rewards, and other perks. Tokens offer benefits and sustainable initiatives to attract an engaged community through entertainment value, which fosters a sense of community around these pre-sales. The downsides of investing in crypto pre-sales One major downside in investing in crypto pre-sales is the high risk of scams and fraud. As the crypto industry is still largely unregulated, scams occur. It is not every pre-sale project that is legitimate, and after raising money some project disappear, which is a phenomenon referred to as a ‘rug pull’. This adds a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of investors to research the team, project, and whitepaper before committing their funds to crypto pre-sale projects. Another downside is the lack of liquidity, as pre-sale investments involve locking up tokens for a set period. This is referred to as a ‘vesting period’ in which the tokens cannot be sold. For some, this lack of liquidity can be a drawback if the market changes, or if the project ends up not performing as well as expected. Another downside is the volatile nature of cryptocurrency, and this also applies to pre-sale tokens. Early access can yield high returns, but they can also plummet in value when the token hits the market, since newly launched tokens experience major price fluctuations as investors profit or the market sentiment shifts. Lastly, there is always uncertainty related to the project outcomes. Since many crypto projects are in their developmental stages when they become available for pre-sales, it also means that there is no guarantee the project will succeed. There is even a risk that the project won’t launch at all. Projects can be derailed, which is a fundamental risk of engaging with crypto pre-sales. Tips for beginners considering crypto pre-sales The first and most important tip for beginners considering crypto pre-sales is to do thorough research. It is important to understand the project, the goals, and the team behind it before investing. What you should look for is a well-written whitepaper, a professional website, and an active community. You should diversify your portfolio by not investing all your funds in one single pre-sale. By spreading out your investment across multiple projects, you are also minimizing your risks. By applying these tips before investing, you can make the most out of the potential benefits of investing in crypto pre-sales.

                    Mastercard’s bold move: Bringing crypto payments to 1 billion users
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Mastercard just made headlines with an announcement that seems like a dream come true for crypto enthusiasts in Europe. They’ve launched a new crypto debit card that promises to bring Bitcoin payments to over 1 billion people and 100 million merchants worldwide. For the first time, you can spend your Bitcoin directly—no need to convert it to fiat currency like dollars or euros. This may seem like a significant leap toward making Bitcoin a recognised legal tender in Europe. It’s convenient, seamless, and puts crypto payments in the hands of everyday users. But as with most things, the devil is in the details. While this move might seem like the future of payments, there’s a catch-or rather, several catches. What is Mastercard’s Crypto Debit Card? Mastercard’s new crypto debit card lets users pay directly with Bitcoin. No more going through centralized exchanges to convert your Bitcoin into traditional currency before you can spend it. The card is compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it easy to use with your phone. Additionally, users stay in full control of their crypto through self-custodial wallets. This means you hold your private keys, not a third party, ensuring your assets are secure. A Step Towards Legal Tender in Europe? This bold move from Mastercard raises the question: Are we getting closer to Bitcoin being treated like legal tender? Mastercard’s integration of Bitcoin into a widely accepted payment method gives it a level of legitimacy we’ve never seen before. This isn’t some niche crypto service; this is Mastercard, one of the biggest financial companies in the world. When Apple Pay and Google Pay two household names are involved, it signals that cryptocurrency is being taken seriously as a form of payment. The more people use it for everyday transactions, the closer Bitcoin moves toward being recognized as a viable payment option in Europe. Limited to the European Market Currently, this product is only available in the European market, which means Nigerians and other global crypto users won’t be able to take advantage of this service just yet. While it’s a significant step for Europe, the high fees associated with the card could make it less appealing, even for European users. This also raises questions about whether this type of product would be accepted or regulated differently in countries outside Europe, like Nigeria, which has a rapidly growing crypto community. The problem: High fees While Mastercard’s crypto debit card could help push Bitcoin into the mainstream, it comes with a hefty price tag: – €1.60 issuance fee. – €1 monthly maintenance fee. – 0.95% fee per transaction. These fees are a major downside. One of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrency has always been that it cuts out the middleman and lowers transaction costs. Blockchain networks like TRON charge only a few cents for transactions, so paying nearly 1% per transaction feels like a step backward into the traditional financial system (TradFi) that crypto is supposed to disrupt. Missed opportunity? Mastercard’s effort could have revolutionised payments by offering a low-cost solution to compete with traditional debit and credit cards. Instead, they’ve added fees reminiscent of the traditional financial institutions that many crypto users seek to avoid. Crypto is supposed to provide cheaper, faster, and more efficient ways to transfer value. However, with these high fees, Mastercard’s product feels more like a missed opportunity. The challenges ahead While Mastercard’s card may allow Bitcoin spending, the company still acts as a middleman by charging fees that don’t align with the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency. As crypto-native payment solutions evolve and offer lower fees, Mastercard could be outpaced by competitors who remain true to crypto’s decentralised vision. For now, Mastercard has the advantage of brand recognition and a vast network of merchants in Europe, but it’s a temporary edge. Is this the future of payments? Mastercard’s crypto debit card is a significant step forward, but it’s not the game-changer it could have been. Yes, it brings Bitcoin to more users and merchants than ever before in Europe, but the high fees could limit its potential. For crypto to truly become the future of payments, the costs need to come down, and companies like Mastercard must embrace decentralisation. Until then, this product might just be another example of traditional finance trying to capitalize on crypto without fully understanding what makes it special. If Mastercard can figure out how to lower their fees and offer a more user-friendly solution, they might have a winner on their hands. But for now, their bold move is spoiled by costs that could drive users away.

Financial Inclusion and Efficiency: Blockchain can extend access to financial services for unbanked populations, speeding up transactions and creating a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Encouraging Innovation Among Youth: Africa’s youth, leading the technological charge, are well-positioned to drive blockchain development, especially in areas like decentralised applications and social impact bonds. Regulation for Growth: Effective regulation is crucial for guiding blockchain innovation without stifling it, creating a stable environment for sustainable development. Global Alignment: Nigeria’s regulatory framework aligns with international standards, boosting cross-border collaboration and investor confidence. Trust Between Innovators and Regulators: Mutual trust is essential, with regulators guiding the industry responsibly and innovators adhering to rules to build confidence in the system. Patriotism and National Development: Innovators were encouraged to prioritise the country’s welfare over personal gain, contributing to Nigeria’s development through responsible blockchain solutions. Balancing Transparency and Privacy: There’s a need to strike the right balance between transparency in blockchain transactions and maintaining privacy for users. Collaboration for a Better Future: The importance of partnerships between regulators, innovators, and other stakeholders to unlock blockchain’s full potential and build strong institutions for economic development. Highlights of the Director General of National Information Technolgy Development Agency’s Keynote Address Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, director general of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), represented by Ayodele Bakare, delivered a keynote speech on “National Digital Economy Policies, Strategies, and the Role of Blockchain Technology,” covering several key themes: Abdullahi’s speech highlighted Nigeria’s digital economy strategy, which focuses on infrastructure development, skills acquisition, innovation support, cybersecurity, and data protection. Blockchain’s role in sectors like financial services, land registry, education, and agriculture was emphasised. NITDA supports blockchain adoption through policy frameworks, partnerships, and a regulatory sandbox. Challenges such as lack of awareness and technical expertise were acknowledged, but blockchain was seen as an opportunity for Nigeria to lead Africa’s digital innovation.

Achievements include the National Blockchain Dialogue Conference, the National Blockchain Strategy, and awareness campaigns. Africa’s unique opportunity lies in leveraging blockchain to leapfrog traditional development models and capitalise on its “brain resources.” Investing in African youth is crucial to preparing them for the blockchain revolution. Keynote Address by Senior Research and Data Analyst at BusinessDay Intelligence In his keynote address Mohammed Akonji, senior Research and Data analyst at BusinessDay Intelligence, made a compelling case for decentralising digital infrastructure, citing global internet outages, including the July 2024 incident that caused $5 trillion in lost revenue. He stressed the vulnerabilities of centralised systems and advocated for blockchain as a solution to eliminate intermediaries, increase transparency, and enhance various sectors like financial services and supply chain management. Blockchain Growth and Africa’s Untapped Potential BusinessDay Intelligence’s research shows explosive blockchain growth, from $1 billion globally in 2020 to $30 billion by 2023, with projections suggesting it could reach $1.8 trillion by 2034. While North America dominates with 46 per cent of the global market, Africa and the Middle East only account for 2 per cent, highlighting massive opportunities for Africa’s economic development. Akonji called for greater investment and understanding of blockchain’s potential in Africa, especially in financial inclusion, healthcare, and supply chain management. Real-World Applications of Blockchain Akonji presented two powerful examples: ● 2018 World Food Programme (WFP) Initiative in Jordan: Blockchain was used to distribute aid to refugees, cutting out intermediaries and saving $1.5 million. ● Global Digital Identification: Over 1 billion people lack formal IDs, and blockchain could help provide secure digital identities, contributing to global development goals. Opportunities for Nigeria Akonji identified key areas for blockchain’s transformative potential in Nigeria: ● Financial Services: Decentralised finance (DeFi) could improve banking access for rural and underserved populations. ● Supply Chain: Blockchain can track fuel consumption and prevent smuggling, ensuring transparency in Nigeria’s petroleum industry. ● Healthcare: Blockchain could revolutionise record-keeping, reduce fraud, and improve patient outcomes in the healthcare sector. BusinessDay Intelligence’s Role As a leading research body, BusinessDay Intelligence is committed to fostering blockchain adoption in Nigeria through: ● Advocacy and Awareness: Educating the public about blockchain’s benefits, noting that only 20 per cent of Nigerians understand how it works. ● Market Research: Providing data-driven insights on blockchain trends, opportunities, and challenges. ● Security and Risk Management: Offering expert analysis on cybersecurity risks and safeguarding digital infrastructure. Akonji concluded with a call to action, urging Nigerian businesses and government agencies to harness blockchain technology for social and economic progress.

                    The People Casting Their Ballots for Crypto
                </h3>

                            Even Kamala Harris is getting in on the game. On Sunday, at a fund-raiser on Wall Street, she told attendees that she would use her Presidency to “encourage innovative technologies” like “digital assets”—her first reference to crypto since embarking on the campaign trail. Still, it’s unclear whether crypto enthusiasts really represent a significant untapped voting bloc. Cryptocurrency is notably—and, to many of its fans, attractively—pseudonymous, making it hard to gauge the total number of people who own it. In 2023, the Federal Reserve estimated that there are roughly eighteen million crypto users in the United States. Anthony Scaramucci, the former Trump adviser turned Trump critic, who runs a hedge fund, has put the number at eighty-five million. (“You have more crypto owners than you have dog owners,” he said, earlier this year.) Only a small number of these people appear to be using crypto as a medium of exchange, given its dramatic fluctuations in value. Many seem to treat it as a stock. What is clear, though, is that crypto is a trillion-dollar industry that the government has been increasingly interested in regulating. In 2023, U.S. lawmakers proposed a regulatory framework for it, and this could have significant financial repercussions. Crypto companies have reportedly poured more than a hundred and nineteen million dollars into the current Presidential campaign. Lately, several companies have also published research arguing that crypto users’ votes can be swayed by candidates’ stances on the technology. In early September, Gemini, a crypto exchange, published a report saying that nearly three-quarters of crypto owners in the U.S. “plan to consider a candidate’s policies toward digital assets” in November. Grayscale, a publicly traded bitcoin fund, put out a report of its own on the 2024 election, in which it claims that “nearly half of voters (47%) now expect some of their investment portfolio to include crypto.” The Grayscale report also states that, while crypto is probably owned by roughly the same number of Democrats as Republicans, crypto-adjacent issues, like inflation, “seem to be valued relatively more by Republicans.” Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami who has studied cryptocurrency users, told me that there is limited academic research on crypto-related questions, but he echoed this general characterization. “Some crypto owners are quite skeptical of the political establishment—that’s why they’re buying crypto in the first place—and Trump is sort of the candidate for that voter,” Uscinski said. “He exudes their skepticism of the system writ large.” But he speculated that there are also “plenty of people who own crypto who are not gonna vote for Trump.” Recently, I attended a crypto meetup near Atlanta titled “Bitcoin Enters the Mainstream Political Arena.” It was organized by Rich Clarke, a real-estate agent in his early forties. Clarke runs Bitcoin Atlanta, a group with a few thousand members. This was Clarke’s first event dedicated to the intersection of cryptocurrency and politics, which, he said, “has always been a touchy subject.” Most crypto enthusiasts have historically been “apathetic to or disillusioned by politics,” he said. Bitcoin, in particular, has long been attached to a pseudo-philosophy of “financial sovereignty,” and its proponents tend to be vocal about what they perceive to be government overreach, in the forms of regulation, censorship, and central banking. Clarke’s interest in crypto began in 2012, after twice supporting Ron Paul for President. “What I walked away with is that operating within the existing system is not gonna get us anywhere,” Clarke told me. “We’ll have to make a new system or a parallel system. I don’t know.” He went on, “At that same time, bitcoin was gaining notoriety. So I was, like, Here’s something I can work on to help lay a new set of tracks.” In late 2020, Clarke, who had worked as an audio engineer in the past, opened a crypto-consulting business, which never took off. In the early days of his interest, he mined some bitcoin. “Having been involved in crypto for as long as I have, people assume I’m a multimillionaire,” he told me. “Truth is, I’ve gambled most of it away. I was irresponsible. But being divorced from the financial aspect has helped me see things more clearly.” Since immersing himself in crypto, Clarke has voted in Presidential elections, “but only begrudgingly”—until this cycle. He was an alternate Trump delegate to the G.O.P. Convention in July, in part because of Trump’s embrace of crypto. “It’s one issue, but it touches other issues,” he said. Clarke thinks that making bitcoin, instead of the U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency could encourage peace. “Since World War One, all U.S. wars are funded largely via inflation,” he argued. “Bitcoin has no central issuer and a fixed supply, so such funding mechanisms would be largely unavailable.” Clarke doesn’t expect Trump to necessarily accomplish this, but, he said, “he can give the technology more room to breathe.” I asked Clarke whether he knew people for whom Trump’s recent support for cryptocurrency would earn him their vote. He related the story of a friend in his thirties who had never voted before but resolved to do so this year, after Trump said that he would pardon Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht is the founder of Silk Road, an online black market that, before it was shut down, facilitated an untold number of illegal transactions through bitcoin, giving the currency one of its first major use cases. In 2015, he received two life sentences without the possibility of parole, for crimes related to drug trafficking, money laundering, and computer hacking. “He’s a folk hero to our community,” Clarke went on. I asked whether he trusted Trump to follow through on his promises. “If you’re trying to weigh voting for somebody who said unambiguously that he likes crypto and that he’d pardon Ross versus somebody who is completely radio-silent on the issue, I think you have to go with the former option—whether he’s lying or not.” Crypto enthusiasts are aware of the stereotypes that cling to them. “We’re used to being portrayed as crazy, fringe weirdos,” Clarke told me. In July, the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One published a paper titled “The Political, Psychological, and Social Correlates of Cryptocurrency Ownership,” which gave an academic imprimatur to some of these perceptions. The paper, co-authored by Uscinski and based on a 2022 survey of two thousand Americans, made the rounds in the crypto world. Clarke read to me from the abstract; individuals who own crypto, it said, “exhibit a diversity of political allegiances and identities. We also found that crypto ownership was associated with belief in conspiracy theories, ‘dark’ personality characteristics (e.g., the ‘Dark Tetrad’ of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism), and more frequent use of alternative and fringe social media platforms.” Many in the community feel that social networks like X are legitimate news sources. The paper reported that crypto owners tend to spend a lot of time online, one of its few findings with which Clarke agreed. “It’s obviously completely biased,” he eventually concluded. “But you can judge for yourself whether you think crypto people have a tendency towards these ‘dark traits’ or whatever.” There was free barbecue at the meetup, and around thirty people were enjoying it when I arrived. Most were male, as anticipated, and bearded. Many were quite friendly. The first person I spoke to at length was Joey, a theatre director in his sixties, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “SINGLE,” “TAKEN,” and “HODLING.” Each word had a box beside it. The “HODLING” box was checked: a bitcoin joke. (“HODL” is an acronym for “hold on for dear life,” a bunker-mentality acknowledgment of crypto’s volatility.) As we sat down to eat some brisket, with Counting Crows blaring in the background, Joey told me that he’d learned about cryptocurrency more than a decade earlier, from his son, who was mining it in their basement. Joey was drawn to “the philosophy around it—the whole concept of how it potentially has the ability for us to have a space to store money without it losing value as our country continues to print money.” I asked about Trump. “He follows what Kennedy thinks,” Joey said, noting his preference for the latter. (Kennedy, who disclosed owning as much as a quarter million dollars’ worth of bitcoin last year, described falling “in love” with it during an interview at the North American Blockchain Summit, last November. “It’s democracy,” he said.) “So is it really the truth? It might be.” He went on, “Trump used to not like bitcoin, now he does. Biden didn’t like it. Maybe he would have changed? Harris doesn’t really have a voice about it yet.” With Kennedy out of the race, Joey was undecided. I bumped into Kamil, a thirty-five-year-old mechatronics engineer born in Poland, who became a U.S. citizen in the late nineties, and has been involved in crypto trading since 2011. He’d once owned hundreds of bitcoins, but, he said, “I was a poor college kid with free magic Internet money, so I was definitely dipping in.” Crypto aligned with Kamil’s belief in “economic freedom.” He’d voted Republican since his first election, in 2016, largely because of crypto policy. “The opposition was heavily against crypto in every way. They wanted to monitor it, restrict it, tax it. So that was an automatic no.” Trump’s new support thrilled him, but he doubted that many crypto enthusiasts who weren’t already voting Republican would switch parties. “I hope Trump’s embrace moves people, but I haven’t seen people change their vote yet. Even people who’d heavily benefit.” Andrew, a bearded fifty-eight-year-old software developer, stood by an amp. “People who’ve studied sound-money principles are pretty much one-issue voters,” he told me, referring to the idea, mostly promulgated by libertarian economists, that financial systems should have limited government intervention and be based around currencies with a limited supply. “Money has to be addressed first. Everything else is nibbling around the edges. Whoever advocates for the best position on that issue is who they vote for.” He went on, “I wouldn’t vote for Democrats normally. But if they’d come out with advocating for protection—to have your own wallet, buy and sell crypto—and Trump had continued calling it scammy, I would have been in a tough spot. But it hasn’t gone that way.” The Wallflowers came on as I sat down next to another bearded and bespectacled man, formerly in I.T., who didn’t initially want to share his name but offered his X handle. (Of all the major social-media platforms, X seems to be the crypto community’s favorite, possibly owing in part to Elon Musk’s fervent support for a cryptocurrency called Dogecoin.) “There were ten U.S. senators in Nashville,” he told me, referring to the conference where Trump spoke. “Donald Trump and R.F.K., Jr. It was amazing.” He described himself as a “centrist” who “doesn’t trust any of the parties,” but his mind was made up. “I was already in Trump camp before I went to Nashville. But I was very pleasantly surprised by Trump. I think Vivek”—Ramaswamy, the Trump-supporting former Republican Presidential candidate and entrepreneur—“told him, ‘Look, there’s free votes sitting here.’ Trump just went and scooped them up. He’s practical.” An I.T. developer named Solomon was having a conversation with Joey, the theatre director. Solomon was talking favorably about Trump “throwing sand in the system.” Joey lauded what he described as Kennedy’s desire “to feed kids good food and prevent all of these sicknesses.” They decried corn subsidies as fiscally and nutritionally suspect—market intervention and corn syrup were both best avoided, they felt. When there was an opening, I asked what Solomon thought about Trump’s shift. “I know some crypto investors who are now more for Trump,” he said. “Those guys . . . they’re open to appeasement. The baby boomer kind of moving towards ‘the economy is messed up, uni-party, pedophiles.’ . . . Not just because of crypto, but in part.” “I’ve been to four or five crypto conferences, and eighty per cent of people I talk to have always been for Trump,” Joey countered. “But when Kennedy came along, and he’s for bitcoin, Trump said, ‘Oh, shit, I’m gonna start losing people over bitcoin.’ So he shifted. He doesn’t know anything about what it is or how it works.” On that point, at least, most of the attendees I spoke to agreed. Clarke, at the microphone, lightened the mood. He told the crowd that he was wearing a five-thousand-dollar T-shirt. “It’s actually an anti-flex,” he said. “I bought it for twenty dollars in bitcoin, in 2014. That value of bitcoin is now five thousand dollars.” There was some sympathetic laughter. He introduced a large man named Wes, who’d provided the brisket and bought his first bitcoin back in 2010, Clarke said, making him among the earliest bitcoin owners present. Wes gave a brief PowerPoint presentation comparing the Presidential candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency. As he recounted Trump’s pledge to free Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, much of the crowd nodded. He then listed some of Trump’s pro-crypto appeals, including his promises to fire the crypto-skeptic S.E.C. chairman, Gary Gensler, and to end “hostile” regulation. “Next up we have Biden,” he said. In what appeared to be a choreographed moment, Clarke interrupted him. “Um, it’s not Biden anymore. It’s Harris.” The crowd chuckled. “Harris isn’t part of the Biden Administration, is she?” Wes said. “I want to be fair.” He listed a few Democrat-authored bills proposing regulation. People shook their heads. Before closing, Wes concluded, “You guys might be jaded, but we are bitcoin owners.” He went on, “Vote for what you think is gonna be the best for bitcoin owners.” Someone asked if a supporter of Harris would like to give a rebuttal. No one did. Before I left, Clarke introduced me to Michael Tidwell, a man in his thirties who wore a “FREE ROSS” T-shirt. “Biden and Harris could free him and they’re not,” he told me. “At least Trump is saying he’d do it.” I asked how he identified politically. “I just like when good shit happens,” he said, adding that he’s for “true liberty.” He used the words “kinda stupid” to describe some of Kennedy’s actions and noted that Trump carried “weird baggage.” He went on, “Typically, I wouldn’t consider voting for someone like that.” He’d never voted for a Presidential candidate before, he added, unless you counted writing in “Rare Pepe” in 2016, in a reference to a crypto-community spinoff of Pepe the Frog. He concluded, “If you want bitcoin to succeed, you’ve got to stand up for the guy in the worst position. Right now, Ross is in the worst position.” He’d be voting for Trump. ♦

                            Memecoins based on political figures are wildly surging as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris's lead on Polymarket early Friday, with multiple Trump-themed tokens commanding two-digit leads going into the weekend.Data from decentralized market prediction platform Polymarket shows that Trump is now just 1 percentage point away from tying his Democratic foe (49% to 50%), marking a stark contrast from last week's numbers, when the vice president led the business mogul by 5 points (52% to 47%).Figures in Battleground States MoveAlso, last week, Harris took four of six swing states being monitored by Polymarket: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. At the time, the former prosecutor had a significant four-point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania. Figures in the Keystone State are particularly crucial since the state is considered the most critical for the warring parties in this year's elections.Harris is still ahead in the abovementioned four states. However, as of Friday, some of the numbers have started to flip. In Pennsylvania, Harris is in the lead at 51% over Trump's 49%.In Wisconsin, Trump added 4% from last week, even if he remains behind the Democratic presidential nominee. On the other hand, Harris widened her lead further in Michigan at 66% to 34% compared to last week's 60% to 40%.Polymarket numbers aren't the only figures changing. Activity around political finance (PolitiFi) memecoins have been spiking in recent days with less than six weeks left before the November elections.$KAMA Leads PolitiFi Memecoins SurgeHarris-based Kamala Horris (KAMA) is leading the political memecoins spike, surging by nearly 49% in the last 24 hours following a week-long rally of 76.7% as per data from CoinGecko.Tooker Kurlson (TOOKER), the token based off of political commentator Tucker Carlson, is in second place in terms of daily gains in the top ranks of the world's largest PolitiFi memecoins by market value. TOOKER has increased by 32.5% in the last day.Coming in third is Trump-based MAGA (TRUMP), which saw a 27.1% surge in the past day. It has been on a 66% increase in the last seven days and remains the world's second-largest PolitiFi memecoin by market cap.Another Trump-themed token, Doland Tremp (TREMP), was also surging overnight, increasing by 25.5% amid a 44.4% weeklong rally. Even Joe Biden-based Jeo Boden (BODEN) pumped in the past week.Many other smaller politics-based tokens surged over the last 24 hours, including Barron Trump-themed Mini Donald (BARRON), which added over 18%, and MoonTrump (TRUMP), which increased by 12%.Americans are set to vote for a new president on Nov. 5. Crypto holders around the country are expected to join in, as crypto's recent inclusion in political discussions is deemed as a "defining moment" for the revolutionary industry.

                    Bitcoin Surges Past $65K Amid Chinese Stimulus Boost
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Bitcoin has surged to trade above $65,000, fueled by a significant influx of capital into U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and China’s ongoing economic stimulus measures. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a notable rebound as investors respond to macroeconomic indicators that hint at a revitalized financial landscape. The substantial investment of $365 million in bitcoin ETFs represents one of the highest daily inflows seen this year, further solidifying the asset’s bullish momentum. In the wake of China’s latest stimulus efforts, which include tax cuts and increased liquidity, various cryptocurrencies are experiencing heightened activity. Conflux’s native token, CFX, is among the standout performers, having appreciated dramatically in value as investor sentiment turns optimistic. The market is responding favorably to news that the People’s Bank of China is implementing measures to stabilize its economy, with analysts suggesting that these developments have created a conducive environment for crypto growth. The recent upward trajectory of Bitcoin and altcoins, such as CFX, aligns with the increasing acceptance of digital assets in mainstream finance. Analysts point to a growing trend where institutional investors are integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios, driven by the search for alternatives amid rising inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. Bitcoin, often regarded as a digital gold, is attracting considerable interest as a hedge against inflation, leading to increased buying activity. Market analysts attribute the surge in Bitcoin’s price not only to the positive market sentiment surrounding Chinese economic policies but also to the broader trends within the cryptocurrency space. The news of significant inflows into U.S. bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader acceptance of regulated investment vehicles that offer exposure to cryptocurrencies. This acceptance could indicate a turning point for Bitcoin, positioning it as a more viable asset class for both retail and institutional investors. The performance of meme coins, driven by the influence of online communities, is adding another layer to the market dynamics. Dog-themed cryptocurrencies are witnessing notable price movements as social media buzz around them intensifies. These movements often reflect the power of community sentiment in the crypto world, where investor behavior can be significantly swayed by trends and narratives that gain traction on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. As Bitcoin continues to attract attention and investment, the potential implications for the wider financial markets are becoming clearer. The integration of digital currencies into traditional financial systems is likely to accelerate, presenting opportunities and challenges for regulators and investors alike. While some experts caution that the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies may pose risks, others emphasize the long-term potential for growth and innovation in the sector.

                    Bitcoin Hits $65K – Why Is $BTC Up Today?

                            Bitcoin has finally broken the $65,000-line after days of struggling between $63,000 and $64,000. The world's first decentralized cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend in recent weeks, but on a slower pace compared to its speedy surges earlier this year.As of early Friday, BTC is trading at around $65,300, data from CoinGecko shows. The digital coin has seen a 3% increase in the last 24 hours and has been surging by over 2% in the past week. Why is Bitcoin up today?Cryptocurrencies are, by nature, volatile. Various aspects around the financial and geopolitical landscape affect the digital assets, but Friday's $BTC spike can be attributed to three factors.Spot $BTC ETFs Log Huge Inflow DayThursday was a big day for U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds collectively hauled in $365.7 million, led by Ark/21 Shares' ARKB ($113.8 million), BlackRock's IBIT ($93.4 million), and Fidelity's FBTC ($74 million), as per data from Farside Investors.The data from Thursday marks the sixth consecutive day of positive inflows in U.S. spot BTC ETFs, triggering optimistic views about the digital currency and driving expectations about Bitcoin finally erasing its often bitter history with the month of September.$BTC Users Look Forward to 'Uptober'Historically, the fourth quarter of the year has been relatively good to the world's top digital currency by market value. For instance, last year, Bitcoin started October at $27,900 and wrapped up the month at $34,600, as per Yahoo Finance data. It ended the year at $42,200.Crypto executive EljaBoom said Wednesday that BTC's "parabolic phase has started," so users should expect an "Uptober," followed by a "Moonvember," a "Pumpcember," and a "Bulluary" to kick off 2025.Gary Gensler Affirms Bitcoin's Legal StatusAlso on Thursday, the Bitcoin community was in an upbeat mood after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler affirmed in an interview that BTC is not a security.While many Bitcoiners have already been sure from the start that BTC is a commodity, Gensler's affirmation brought excitement and renewed trust among smaller Bitcoin holders who may have started losing faith due to the SEC's enforcement-first approach toward digital assets.Harris-Walz Economic Playbook Mentions Digital AssetsPossibly lingering through Friday was the impact of the economic plan published by the Harris-Walz campaign, which mentioned digital assets, albeit just once throughout the 80-page playbook.Some prominent figures in the crypto space welcomed Vice President Kamala Harris's seemingly softer stance on the industry, considering how the Biden administration was not as friendly to the sector.Bitcoin has been on a wild ride in recent months, but it wavered multiple headwinds throughout the second quarter, including the massive German government dump and two crypto market bloodbaths in August.

                    Rexas Finance (RXS) vs. Hamster Kombat (HMSTR): Which is the Next Big Cryptocurrency for a 20x ROI?
                </h3>

                            Rexas Finance (RXS) and Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) are two notable projects drawing investor attention as the crypto market heats up, with new ones emerging regularly. Both projects are in every investor’s mouth; whereas RXS is making waves with its presale performances, HMSTR is generating enthusiasm with its approaching airdrop for a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem. The important question is which of these two newly developed cryptocurrencies offers the best possibility of a 20x return on investment (ROI). Rexas Finance (RXS): What is it? Designed to tokenize real-world assets—such as real estate, artwork, and precious metals—Rexas Finance is a blockchain-based platform that allows fractional ownership to make these accessible to individual investors. Currently in its third presale session, RXS is the platform's primary coin and has raised almost $1.28 million thus far. Using blockchain technology's security and openness, the platform seeks to democratize asset ownership by allowing investors to buy, sell, and swap pieces of valuable assets.Rexas Finance offers several innovative tools, including Rexas Token Builder, which streamlines tokenizing assets, and Rexas Treasury. This multi-chain yield optimizer allows consumers to earn compound interest on their Bitcoin deposits. Using these techniques, Rexas Finance is building an ecosystem linking traditional financial assets to the blockchain, therefore establishing it as a possible competitor in the rapidly expanding tokenized asset market.As Rexas Finance gets ready for a public listing at $0.20, investors should make really large earnings. Early investors are already showing great desire for RXS tokens, with a possible 6x return for those who join the presale at the present price of $0.050. The presale is still under process. Hamster Kombat (HMSRT): What is It? A play-to-earn game on the blockchain called Hamster Kombat has gone viral in the cryptocurrency gaming community. After a successful first season, the project is getting ready for its much-awaited September 26, 2024, HMSTR token airdrop. Tokens can be obtained by Hamster Kombat players through gaming, and an airdrop is available to those who linked their wallets to their accounts by the September 20 snapshot.Based on pre-market trading statistics, the HMSTR coin is anticipated to debut between $0.10 and $0.30 in price. Millions of gamers are excitedly awaiting the token's formal release, and the game's fan base is expanding quickly. Hamster Kombat's play-to-earn strategy has already proven successful, and the impending token launch may help the game reach new heights in the cryptocurrency gaming market.Although there is excitement surrounding the token airdrop, concerns exist over the token's long-term viability. The post-launch price performance of HMSTR tokens will be significantly influenced by market demand, the overall quantity of HMSTR tokens, and the game's developmental plans. Nonetheless, Hamster Kombat is positioned as a significant participant in the play-to-earn ecosystem because of the sheer size of the airdrop. Reasons Rexas Finance (RXS) May Yield a 20x ROI Ahead of Hasmster Kombat (HMSRT) Rexas Finance is better positioned to provide a 20x return on investment than Hamster Kombat, even though both initiatives are exciting: Real-World Use Case Rexas Finance distinguishes itself by introducing real-world assets to the blockchain, such as artwork and real estate. This creative approach allows investors to engage in a multitrillion-dollar market and acquire usually illiquid assets. Along with blockchain acceptance, the demand for tokenized assets is expected to grow, hence raising the value of RXS tokens. Solid Ecosystem Rexas Finance is a whole ecosystem, not just a coin. Users can easily generate and manage tokens, receive interest on their deposits, and start their token sales with features like the Rexas Launchpad, Rexas Treasury, and the Rexas Token Builder. This extensive toolkit distinguishes Rexas Finance from other blockchain initiatives by presenting it as a flexible platform with practical applications. VC Snub The cryptocurrency community has taken a liking to Rexas Finance's choice to forego venture capital funding in favor of a public presale. This action does not restrict access to institutional investors; instead, it enables individual investors to participate early and profit from the project's success. Rexas Finance is creating a community-driven platform that will probably experience steady growth over time by putting the needs of the general population first. Robust Tokenomics Rexas Finance has crafted its tokenomics to guarantee enduring viability. One billion RXS tokens can be produced in total, with portions going to the treasury, marketing, liquidity, and staking pools. With careful supply management ensured by this balanced strategy, the token's value may rise over time due to increased demand.Keeping these things in mind, Rexas Finance is in a good position to offer investors who participate in the presale and hold their tokens as the business develops a 20x return on investment. Conclusion While Rexas Finance and Hamster Kombat are both exciting initiatives with high potential rewards, Rexas Finance is the superior choice for investors seeking a 20x return on investment. With its emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets, demonstrated investor interest, and extensive toolkit ecosystem, Rexas Finance is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the cryptocurrency market. Though exciting, Hamster Kombat's play-to-earn concept raises questions about the token's long-term viability. Rexas Finance might be a better option for those looking for the next big thing in cryptocurrency.

                    Memecoins Surge, Brett Crypto Price Rallies, and Infinaeon Teases DEX
                </h3>

                            The recent memecoin surge has resulted in the Brett crypto price hitting double-digit gains along with other notable meme plays such as SHIB and WIF. The sudden rise in the value of memecoins has followed several days of positive sentiment following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates. Mega-cap coins such as Bitcoin, Ether, and SOL have also been rallying, even if the memecoins and smaller alts are leading the way. Whether the rally is sustainable is up for debate. Ethereum is especially under pressure due to skyrocketing transaction fees. The Infinaeon project, a layer-2 ecosystem, has just dropped a video teasing its DEX, bridge, and scaling solutions. This has given the market hope that the Ether congestion issue can be overcome. This anticipation has translated into a growing interest in the Infinaeon presale. This article will explore the recent memecoin rally, with a focus on the Brett crypto price surge. It will also examine the challenges faced by Ethereum due to network congestion and delve into how Infinaeon’s Layer-2 solution aims to address these issues. Crypto Memecoin Market Surges Following Interest Rate Cut The FED’s rate cut has been followed by a rush of capital into the crypto market. Memecoins have been especially popular with traders. Billions of dollars have been added to the market caps of the top 20 memecoins. SHIB has surged by 20%, bringing its market capitalization to within touching distance of $10 billion. Lower interest rates tend to make traditional investments less attractive, as they offer lower yields. This can push investors towards riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, in search of higher returns. memecoins, with their potential for explosive growth, often become a prime target for such capital flows. Brett Price Gains 14% The Brett crypto price has been heavily boosted following the rate cut. The Solana-based memecoin has gained around 14% in the past week, giving it a market cap of over $900 million. Brett, also known as Based Brett, is a memecoin built on the Base blockchain, inspired by the character Brett from the Boy’s Club comic series. It’s positioned as Pepe’s best friend and has gained significant traction within the crypto community. While the recent price surge is encouraging, it’s important to remember that Brett, like other memecoins, is highly susceptible to market sentiment and speculation Official Infinaeon Video Teases DEX and Bridge While speculators try to position themselves in the memecoin market, more serious investors looking for big returns have turned to the Infinaeon presale. The amount of interest in the sale has grown following an official team video detailing the project’s DEX and bridge. The video, released earlier this week, showcased the user interface and functionalities of Infinity Swap, Infinaeon’s native decentralized exchange (DEX). It highlighted the platform’s intuitive design, fast transaction speeds, and low fees, aiming to provide a seamless trading experience for users. Infinity Swap will also feature Infinaeon Plus as its primary wrapped ETH asset, allowing projects to benefit from its value appreciation mechanism. Another key aspect showcased in the video was Infinaeon’s bridge. This feature enables efficient and secure asset transfers between the Ethereum mainnet and the Infinaeon Layer-2 network. By providing a seamless bridge, Infinaeon aims to enhance interoperability and facilitate the movement of assets within its ecosystem. These developments have further fueled the excitement surrounding the Infinaeon presale. The project’s commitment to delivering on its roadmap and providing tangible solutions to Ethereum’s scaling challenges has resonated with the community. The DEX and bridge teasers offer a glimpse into the project’s potential and demonstrate its progress towards creating a robust and user-friendly Layer-2 ecosystem. This has led to increased confidence among investors, who see Infinaeon as a promising long-term investment opportunity. The 8% bonus has added to the hype around the Infinaeon presale. Infinaeon Presale Bonus Drives Bullish Sentiment The presale has been boosted both by the teasers and by the 8% bonus on early-stage sales. This attractive offer, combined with the project’s deflationary tokenomics and potential for long-term value appreciation, has created a sense of urgency among investors. Infinaeon’s unique approach to gas fee allocation, where a portion of fees is used to buy and burn its native token, has garnered significant attention. This mechanism creates scarcity and supports the token’s value, incentivizing early participation in the presale. The combination of the presale bonus, deflationary tokenomics, and the promise of a robust Layer-2 solution has generated a wave of bullish sentiment around Infinaeon. As the presale progresses, the growing interest and excitement suggest a bright future for the project and its potential to deliver substantial returns for its early backers.

                    Bull Run Next? Crypto Community Prepares To Welcome Binance's CZ From Prison
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">

                            After serving four months in jail following his guilty plea for failing to establish adequate guardrails to protect Binance users, co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, dearly known as CZ in the cryptocurrency community, is set for release on Sunday.For the crypto community, CZ is not just a former crypto executive. To many in the industry, Zhao is a legend whom many smaller digital asset holders look up to for his rags-to-riches story.Three days before his scheduled release, the crypto space is already on fire, preparing to welcome the crypto OG back. Many are looking forward to what he will do next after he stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of his guilty plea that sought to avoid further litigation. Others shared their theories on how the crypto leader's release will affect the burgeoning sector.CZ's Release to Trigger a Bull Run?A vast majority of crypto users who are looking forward to CZ's prison release believe a bull run is in sight. Well-followed @danielgothits expects a "golden bull run," while David, the founder of Web3 and crypto marketing firm Scal3, expects markets to pump.One user said the "Uptober Ceazon" is inbound. The fourth quarter of the year has historically been positive for Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency by market value.CZ's release in time for the BTC's expected spike can be good for the crypto market, as most tokens get dragged up when Bitcoin surges.Making Room for a New Inmate?One X user had a different take on Zhao's upcoming release, saying it appears he made room for Caroline Ellison, who, earlier this week, was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the $11 billion collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.Ellison was SBF's ex-girlfriend and a former executive at FTX sister company Alameda Research who was also a star witness for the prosecution in SBF's trial. Her legal team sought zero jail time for their client, citing her role in helping get 25 years for Bankman-Fried.A Bull Run for BNB Memes?While many are expecting a broader crypto market surge upon Zhao's release, an Ethereum user suggested that a bull run may be more limited to meme tokens on the BNB Chain, the blockchain network initially developed by Binance.Among the most engaged memecoins on the BNB Chain, which operates independently of its crypto giant developer, are MEMEBET, SHIBASHOOT, and CATGIRL.Out With the Old, In With the NewThere are also theories that CZ will "build the next biggest thing" once he steps out of jail. Such a notion may not be far from reality, as Zhao announced ahead of his sentencing in April that he was working on a new project: Giggle Academy.The new project is a free, online education platform that will use blockchain-based tokens to certify the achievements of students.After his sentencing, Zhao promised that after closing his leadership chapter in Binance, he "will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto)." At the time, he reminded the crypto space that "compliance is super important."Binance After CZSince Zhao left Binance, the crypto exchange titan has faced multiple legal debacles, including an ongoing case in Nigeria, where the exchange's chief compliance officer Tigran Gambaryan remains in prison.The crypto giant was also fined over $4 million by a Canadian regulator earlier this year for alleged anti-money laundering violations.
