                            Pig butchering, the crypto-based scammer scourge that has pulled in an estimated $75 billion
                            from victims globally, is spreading beyond its roots in Southeast Asia, with operations
                            proliferating across the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. The
                            UK's National Crime Agency disclosed new details about the identities of the Russian
                            ransomware group known as Evil Corp—as well as the group's ties to Russian intelligence
                            agencies and even its direct participation in espionage operations targeting NATO allies. A
                            WIRED investigation revealed how car-mounted automatic license plate reader cameras are
                            capturing far more than just license plates, including campaign yard signs, bumper stickers,
                            and other politically sensitive text, all examples of how a system for tracking vehicles
                            threatens to become a broader surveillance tool. In other news, ICE signed a $2 million
                            contract with Paragon Solutions, a known vendor of spyware including the hacking tool
                            Graphite. And the Pentagon is increasingly adopting handheld controllers for weapons systems
                            in an effort provide more intuitive interfaces to soldiers who have grown up playing Xbox
                            and PlayStation consoles. And there's more. Each week, we round up the privacy and security

                            stay safe out there. The FBI Still Hasn’t Cracked the Phone of Indicted NYC Mayor Eric Adams
                            As the politics of America's biggest city have been turned upside down by the criminal
                            charges against New York mayor Eric Adams, there's still a “significant wild card” in the
                            corruption case against him, prosecutors said in court this week: The FBI can't manage to
                            get into his phone. Prosecutors in the case against Adams, which centers on alleged illegal
                            payments the mayor received from the Turkish government, revealed that the FBI still hasn't
                            cracked the encryption on Adams' personal phone, nearly a year after it was seized. That
                            phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams'
                            personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By
                            that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six
                            digits—a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally
                            deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately “forgot” that code to
                            unlock it. That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation
                            similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed
                            Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's
                            encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that
                            case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded—and expensive—hacking
                            technique to unlock the device. In Adams' case, prosecutors hinted that the FBI may have to
                            resort to similar measures. “Decryption always catches up with encryption,” a prosecutor in
                            the case, Hagan Scotten, told the judge. Harvard Students Add Face Recognition to Meta’s
                            Smart Glasses Face recognition is one of only a few technologies that even Facebook and
                            Google have hesitated to integrate into products like Google Glass and the Ray-Ban Meta
                            smart glasses—and rightly so, given the privacy implications of a device that would allow
                            anyone to look at a stranger on the street and immediately determine their phone number and
                            home address. Now, however, a group of Harvard students has shown how easy it is to bolt
                            that face recognition onto Meta's augmented-reality eyewear. The project, known as I-XRAY,
                            integrates with the face-recognition service Pimeyes to let Ray-Ban Meta wearers learn the
                            name of virtually anyone they see and then immediately scour databases of personal
                            information to determine other info about them, including names of family members, phone
                            numbers, and home addresses. The students say they're not releasing the code for their
                            experiment, instead intending it as a demonstration of the privacy-invasive potential of
                            augmented-reality devices. Point made. Meta Says It Will Train Its AI on Input from Smart
                            Glasses If that warning about the privacy risks of AR eyewear needed more reinforcement,
                            Meta this week also conceded to TechCrunch that it will use input from users' smart glasses
                            to train its AI products. Initially, Meta declined to answer TechCrunch's questions about
                            whether and how it would collect information from Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses for use as AI
                            training data, in contrast to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that explicitly say they
                            don't exploit user inputs to train their AI services. A couple of days later, however, Meta
                            confirmed to TechCrunch that it does in fact use images or video collected through its smart
                            glasses to train its AI, but only if the user submits them to Meta's AI tools. That means
                            anything that a user sees and asks Meta's AI chatbot to comment on or analyze will become
                            part of Meta's massive AI-training data trove. Microsoft and the DOJ Seize 100+ Domains Used
                            by Russian Spies If you can't arrest Russian hackers, at least you can nab their web
                            domains. That, at least, is the approach this week of the US Justice Department, which along
                            with Microsoft and the NGO Information Sharing and Analysis Center used a lawsuit to take
                            control of more than a hundred web domains that had been used by Russian hackers working for
                            the Kremlin's intelligence and law enforcement agency known as the FSB. Those domains had
                            been exploited in phishing campaigns by the Russian hacker group known as Star Blizzard,
                            which has a history of targeting the typical victims of geopolitical spying such as
                            journalists, think tanks, and NGOs. The domain seizures seem designed in part to head off

                            takes time, absorbs resources, and costs money,” Steven Masada, the assistant general

                            [the hackers'] operations at a critical point in time when foreign interference in US
                            democratic processes is of utmost concern.”

                    “Trump Promotes Watches, Cryptocurrency, and Wife’s Book in Final Weeks of Campaign”

                            A new cryptocurrency platform. An upcoming memoir authored by his wife. A set of NFT trading
                            cards. Watches that cost as much as $100,000. With just weeks left before the November
                            election, former President Donald Trump has taken to promoting items and businesses that are
                            not at all connected to his presidential campaign. “You’re going to love them,” Trump wrote
                            on his Truth Social platform last week of his new line of branded watches, which cost
                            anywhere from $499 to $100,000. They’re being offered through a vendor that has a licensing
                            agreement with him. “Would make a great Christmas gift.” While running for president this
                            cycle, Trump has also promoted a sneaker brand, boots and even Bibles — all of which are
                            business and not campaign ventures. He has long mixed business with politics; prior to his
                            legal battles that have raged for years now, those potential conflicts of interest were the
                            subject of far greater attention. But the fact that Trump is promoting his business
                            interests again in the closing weeks of the campaign has his Democratic rivals saying it is
                            proof he is unfocused, and even some of his allies saying the effort is unwise. “I think
                            that he’s distracted,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, told NBC News. “He’s off his
                            message and he’s probably focused on what comes next after he loses the presidential race,
                            which is to continue to try to perpetuate these dicey schemes on people for his own profit.”
                            Reached for comment, a Trump campaign official said “these are all outside business
                            ventures,” adding that “no proceeds come to the campaign.” For the former president’s
                            supporters, it’s unlikely the focus on these other ventures would shift their opinion of
                            him, even though Trump was subject to some conservative backlash in 2022 when he first
                            announced an NFT line, teasing it as a “MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT” soon after he launched his
                            re-election bid. “I’m not too much worried about that,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said.
                            “Donald Trump is a businessman first, second and third. But his primary focus, purpose,
                            focus number one, two, three, four, five, is running for president and making our country
                            great again. That’s his focus.” “Everybody has things that we’re involved in personally,” he
                            added. “You have members of Congress who write books and then promote the books. So, I mean,
                            I’m not really concerned about that.” But others felt it highlighted a bigger issue with the
                            state of Trump’s candidacy, specifically that difficult conversations aren’t being had.
                            “It’s just the lack of discipline around him right now,” one Trump ally said. “There is no
                            one telling him ‘no’ very clearly. Do I think that a single Trump voter in America is not
                            voting for him because of any of this? Absolutely no. But they still haven’t [really] told
                            people [why] Kamala Harris would be a bad president. And that seems like it should probably
                            be the messaging priority.” Within the last week, Trump tweeted about how he “promised to
                            Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” in announcing that his new platform, World
                            Liberty Financial, now had a “whitelist for eligible persons” open. And ahead of the release
                            of former first lady Melania Trump’s new book, “Melania,” Trump promoted a link to her
                            website calling on supporters to “Buy your copy today.” In February, Trump attended a shoe
                            convention in Philadelphia to announce the release of a new line of Trump-branded sneakers.
                            Meanwhile, his latest financial disclosure showed that he made $300,000 off of Trump-branded
                            Bibles he promoted earlier this year. That same financial disclosure revealed he made about
                            $7.2 million from the NFTs he promoted. The Harris campaign sees Trump’s side hustles during
                            the campaign as bolstering a core part of their message about him: that he is more focused
                            on helping himself than on helping voters. “He is making the argument for our campaign,” a
                            Harris campaign official said. “And he’s making the argument to the American people of who
                            he cares about, day in and day out. And we’ll let that speak for itself.” Describing the
                            business ventures as a “grift,” the official went further, saying of Trump’s latest branded
                            merchandise: “It’s just objectively an ugly watch.” Long before he entered politics, Trump
                            had promoted similar product lines, whether Trump Steaks or Trump Vodka. Trump ended up
                            paying out a $25 million settlement to students of Trump University — the former president’s
                            real estate education venture — who said they were duped. Trump’s new watch line contributed
                            to the resurfacing of remarks Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made during a 2016 GOP primary
                            debate, during which Rubio said Trump inherited hundreds of millions of dollars and that if
                            he hadn’t, “you know where he’d be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan.” “He wants to do
                            everything and anything and throw everything against the wall,” the Trump ally said.
                            “Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it’s not. Sometimes it helps you. Sometimes we’re posting
                            NFTs or whatever.” “No one is saying, ‘Hey, sir, why don’t we not do that right now?’” this
                            person added. “And that just seems to be the only reasonable explanation for this right
                            now.”

                            process that creates new Bitcoins — and it is done by computers performing complex

                            doing complex work produce heat. Large-scale crypto mining operations often have massive

                            NETWORKS in Provo, Utah. He is currently running pilot programs for a plug-and-play system
                            where people can essentially have small-scale Bitcoin miners act as space heaters in their
                            homes — and save a lot of money on their heating bills. Bomsta’s company also shares some of
                            the Bitcoin mining profits with homeowners. Bomsta says that homeowners don’t need to know
                            anything about Bitcoin in order to participate. “We essentially just say, ‘Hey, if you're
                            willing to host a piece of our distributed data center, we can lower your monthly heating
                            bill by anywhere from $200 to $600 depending on your home and the market dynamics in your
                            area,’” says Bomsta. Bomsta’s team shows up with the Bitcoin miners, sets them up and plugs
                            them into the wall in different places throughout the home where they will evenly distribute
                            heat. The miners are essentially computers the size of a large air purifier and as loud as a
                            typical space heater. The technician can hook them up to Wi-Fi so you can control the
                            temperature of the room as you would with a thermostat. Where mining makes sense Bomsta’s
                            system makes the most economic sense for people who live in an area where propane is
                            expensive and electricity is cheap. The miners run on electricity, so you can expect that
                            cost to go up as your propane costs go down — but Bomsta says homeowners should still come
                            out ahead. According to Bomsta, residents in Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, North and
                            South Dakota and Montana — where one of unbound NETWORK’s pilot programs is currently
                            running — are most likely to benefit. Bomsta estimates that there are close to a million
                            homes in the U.S. that could be good candidates for this kind of system. It’s a symbiotic
                            relationship: Bomsta’s company gets space in a house and free electricity to mine Bitcoin,
                            and homeowners get heat at a reduced cost. Customers also earn a share of the Bitcoin that
                            is mined. Bomsta says that anywhere from 5% to 35% of the Bitcoin rewards generated are
                            shared with the homeowner, either in Bitcoin or transferred as dollars into the homeowner’s
                            bank account. The DIY approach While Bomsta is trying to create a plug-and-play solution,
                            others are creating systems for themselves. Cody Harris, co-founder of Citadel Construction
                            in Lander, Wyoming, and his wife are building a new home, and they decided to make a Bitcoin
                            mining system that would heat their house via radiant floor heat. Harris has no engineering
                            background, but that hasn’t stopped him from building his own setup. He learned through
                            YouTube, online forums and lots of trial and error. Similar to Bomsta’s system, Harris’
                            system is automated to turn on when the temperature drops. With a DIY system, there are two
                            important costs to consider: The cost to install it and the cost to run it. Harris says he
                            comes out ahead on both counts. He believes the total cost of parts for his system (not
                            including the radiant floor components) will be around $3,500 — similar to the price of a
                            propane boiler. The cost of running the system is a little more variable, because you have
                            to factor in the highly volatile price of Bitcoin. But for Harris, so far it has worked in
                            his favor. “Last winter, I was basically producing free power,” says Harris. “The miners
                            were producing the exact same amount of Bitcoin that it was costing me in electricity to run
                            them. So if I was spending $100 a week to heat my house, I was making $100 a week in
                            Bitcoin.” Harris' rig is a part of a larger collective of miners who share the Bitcoin
                            profits of what they mine. Savvy energy savings Building your own Bitcoin mining heater may
                            feel unapproachable, but anyone who makes the leap could help the tides turn in the
                            direction of more efficient, more resourceful heating. “It's just always going to come down
                            to who has the cheapest energy and who can be the most efficient with the use of it,” says
                            Harris. Even for someone so involved in the creation of his own setup, Harris is still
                            pretty excited by the thought of it. “Miraculously, it just works.”

                    A victim of a crypto ‘pig butchering’ scam just got his $140,000 back

                            Aleksey Madan never thought the day would come. This week he received a $140,000 check in
                            the mail from Massachusetts officials. That was the full amount Madan had lost after falling
                            for a get-rich-quick crypto scam. “How would you feel if all your money was stolen and you
                            never expected to get it back, then you did?” said Madan, 69. “It feels amazing. I’m
                            overjoyed. And also in shock.” Those funds were among the hundreds of thousands of dollars’
                            worth of cryptocurrency Massachusetts authorities seized from a fraudulent operation that
                            targeted Russian-speaking seniors online and, in some cases, stole their life savings. The
                            Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office began investigating the company, known as SpireBit,
                            followed an NPR investigation last year detailing the stories of two victims who were lured
                            into an investment scheme, only to realize it was a sham after they transferred large
                            quantities of money into SpireBit’s cryptocurrency wallets. SpireBit drew victims into its
                            ruse by using ads on social media promising lucrative investment returns. SpireBit took out
                            ads on Facebook and Instagram that falsely portrayed Elon Musk as endorsing the company
                            through a Russian voice-over. But NPR could find no trace of a real investment company: The
                            people listed as the company’s executives turned out to be just stock photos and fake
                            LinkedIn profiles. A supposed London address for SpireBit turned out to be a kitchenware
                            business. When victims tried to withdraw their money, the company sent them forged bank
                            documents. After NPR’s reporting, financial regulators in the United Kingdom issued a public
                            warning about SpireBit, classifying it as an operation run by “fraudsters.” When NPR tried
                            to reach out to SpireBit for comment last year, it responded through the Telegram messaging
                            app by stating that crypto trading is volatile, and saying "the activities of our company
                            are regulated according to the legislation of the country in which the head office of the
                            company is located." Now, that account has been deleted. NPR’s investigation caught the
                            attention of Massachusetts authorities, who in December sued SpireBit under its incorporated
                            entity known as SBT Investments. Investigators posed as a SpireBit customer and were able to
                            pinpoint crypto wallets used by SpireBit. In a judgment issued in May, state officials won a
                            court order that froze the company’s assets on the trading platform Binance. While the full
                            extent of SpireBit’s operation remains unknown, the company’s tactics are part of a
                            proliferating type of online fraud known as pig butchering. The name comes from the process
                            of gaining someone’s trust and building a friendship with them over the course of weeks or
                            months — fattening up the pig before the kill, which in this case means stealing a large sum
                            of money. According to the FBI, crypto scammers stole more than $5.6 billion from Americans
                            online last year. According to the May court order, investigators in Massachusetts were able
                            to seize a total of $269,000 from SpireBit’s crypto wallet, most of which is being
                            distributed to four victims in the state. Another SpireBit victim profiled by NPR, Naum
                            Lantsman, 75, of Los Angeles, lost his life savings of $340,000 that he earned over decades
                            as a small business owner. His family reported the theft to the California Attorney
                            General’s Office, but a formal investigation was never initiated. Officials from the
                            Massachusetts and California attorney general offices did not return interview requests.

                            CLEVELAND, Ohio – Federal prosecutors are seeking to claim $200,000 worth of cryptocurrency
                            that was siphoned from an investor in Ashtabula. Bitcoin valued at about $340,000 was
                            fraudulently transferred from the investor’s virtual currency wallet in February, according
                            to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Cleveland on Thursday. The victim did not seek
                            the transaction. Investigators analyzed a public ledger of crypto transactions to trace the
                            funds to two accounts, the documents show. Authorities found that the bitcoin from the
                            Ashtabula investor was converted to Tether, a cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar and
                            created by Tether Limited Inc. In March, a month after the theft, Tether Limited Inc. froze
                            the two accounts. Federal investigators filed a seizure warrant in July for the funds.
                            Tether Limited later transferred $200,000 worth of cryptocurrency from the two accounts to a
                            federal law enforcement fund. Authorities are seeking to return the funds to the investor,
                            though the value of the investment has dropped since the theft. Prosecutors must first go
                            through forfeiture proceedings with the owners of the two addresses. But the owners of the
                            addresses are unknown, prosecutors said in the documents. A court filing indicates that the
                            scheme originated in Nigeria. The court filings in the case say FBI agents in Cleveland are
                            “investigating cryptocurrency confidence fraud scams perpetrated on victims throughout the
                            United States, including in the Northern District of Ohio.”

                    Bitcoin jumps over $62,000 on sparkling jobs report

                            The jobs numbers also translated into a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin, which had tumbled
                            6% earlier this week, dropping to around $60,000, partly in response to instability in the
                            Middle East. Bitcoin experienced a gradual rise in the runup to the release of the job
                            report. The top cryptocurrency dipped slightly in the hours following the release, before
                            spiking over 1%, according to data collected by CoinGecko. Other cryptocurrencies like
                            Ethereum and XRP saw similar jumps as well. For some analysts this is a good sign for the
                            crypto market but for Omid Malekan, a professor at the Columbia Business School, it remains
                            unclear how this information will impact Bitcoin prices in the long-term. Despite increasing
                            124% in the past year and hitting an all-time high of $72,000 in March, Malekan pointed out
                            that the price of Bitcoin has bounced around $62,000 over the last eight months. “We know
                            the economy is strong, or stronger than expected,” he said. “And if that’s the case, then
                            the Fed is not going to cut interest rates as long as people had hoped, but given what
                            happened for most of this year, it is unclear to me what impact any of that has on the price
                            of Bitcoin.” The business professor also acknowledged the uncertainty associated with other
                            macroeconomic factors like the upcoming election. “The polls, the betting markets, the
                            experts, everyone thinks it’s kind of going to toss up over who is going to win. So, it’s
                            possible that the uncertainty over that is just weighing over crypto prices,” Malekan said.
                            “It’s a confusing time, because the usual relationships have not been working,” Malekan
                            said. “And when they don’t work in one direction, then you have to question whether they’re
                            going to work in the other direction.” According to the report, the unemployment rate fell
                            to 4.1% in August from 4.2%. These numbers, in addition to slowing rates of inflation,
                            reduce the probability that the Federal Reserve will continue aggressive rate cuts.

                            The term wallet is actually not new. You probably have used some kind of folding case to
                            hold your money or plastic cards in the past. Crypto wallets are based on this similar idea,
                            only that they store the passkeys for your crypto transactions instead of holding physical
                            cash. With the number of these facilities rapidly increasing, finding the best one can
                            sometimes be tedious. Actually, Fortune Market Insights highlights that the global crypto
                            wallets market revenue has already passed the US$ 1,505.9 million mark and is on its way to
                            hit US$ 3,675.4 million by 2033. This shows a growth of about 9.3% CAGR within ten years
                            only. So, in this article, we try to look at the reasons behind this growth and factors you
                            can consider when choosing the best crypto wallet. Read on to learn more. Why are more
                            people turning to crypto wallets? Have you ever thought about the possibility of keeping
                            multiple cryptocurrencies from several blockchains on a similar wallet? This is just one of
                            the many benefits of crypto wallets. The Best Wallet crypto storage, for instance, supports
                            thousands of crypto on more than 50 major blockchains. This way, you can always be sure to
                            manage and trade all your digital currencies on the same platform. As you might actually
                            know, supporting more than one crypto can be quite cost-effective. Do you really remember
                            the early days of NFT when those who owned collections for sale only used ETH for minting?
                            If you do, you can relate to how the ‘gas’ fees were quite high, so creators started using
                            other alternatives like Solana. This is what actually, in part, resulted in multicurrency
                            crypto wallets that can support such demands. Plus, it just is sometimes good to be able to
                            store several coins – especially when you can take advantage of price differences of a
                            particular asset in different markets. And do you know that there are some wallets that can
                            handle digital forms of fiat money as well? Why wouldn’t you want to keep your dollars
                            alongside your Ethereum tokens? And, for those who want to diversify their portfolio,
                            multicurrency crypto wallets can be very helpful. Considerations for choosing the best
                            crypto wallet Checking the security of the wallet can actually be a great way to get you
                            started. You may want to consider whether the wallet has things like 2FA to strengthen its
                            security. By the way, do you actually know that 2FA alone can reduce the risk of exposure to
                            targeted attacks by about 99.9%? Plus, you can check whether the wallet stores passwords
                            offline or not. According to Jeff Owens, the CEO of Haven1, a Layer 1 blockchain that
                            addresses on-chain hacks, using wallets that store private keys offline can be one of the
                            most secure options. PIN protection and recovery seed phrases are other features that you
                            can look for. It might be noteworthy to mention that as much as ensuring security is
                            important, you need to balance that with convenience. This is where soft wallets beat hard
                            wallets. But again, paper wallets carry the risk of being physically damaged even though
                            they aren’t as susceptible to cyber-attacks. If you hold large sums of crypto, you may want
                            to consider paper wallets as they are less susceptible to cyber-attacks. Just recently, in
                            2023, Chainalysis conducted a survey that found approval phishing scams to be rampant. Here,
                            scammers can trick you into signing a malicious transaction that grants them access to your
                            wallet. Can you imagine that such incidences led to losses of about $374.6 million worth of
                            crypto that year alone? That’s why it is important to double the destination of your
                            transactions a couple of times to minimize the chances of mirroring scams. What are other
                            features that you can consider? As the number of security threats increases, developers are
                            turning to technology to develop innovative solutions to reduce exposure. And these are some
                            of the features you should be looking for in a crypto wallet. Let us take the example of
                            biometric authentication. Are you aware that, according to a recent Verizon report, about
                            75% of data breaches resulted from human error, stolen credentials, and misuse? To reduce
                            the chances of such events, you can inspect a wallet to see whether it allows biometric
                            authentication. Smart contracts can really help if you want to minimize the risk of human
                            error. For instance, multiparty computation (MPC) can divide private keys into several parts
                            and perform transactions automatically, offering more security. The bottom line Crypto
                            wallets are among the components of your cryptocurrency toolbox that you would want to pay
                            attention to. But now that these tools have become a legion, it may make sense to do some
                            level of research before one chooses any. The good thing is that thanks to the internet, all
                            you need to do is pick up your phone and search for reviews online. Here in this article, we
                            only look at a few features like security to start you off – but there are many others. And,
                            of course, the opinions presented here are purely based on the author’s research and may not
                            necessarily reflect the site’s position.

                            This article explores the importance of flexibility in the crypto world, focusing on the
                            process of swapping tokens across different blockchain networks. The power of flexibility in
                            crypto: why token swapping matters The crypto world is dynamic and ever-evolving. What
                            started with Bitcoin has now grown into a complex ecosystem with hundreds of blockchains,
                            thousands of tokens, and countless possibilities for users. But with this complexity comes
                            the need for flexibility, especially when it comes to swapping tokens. Whether you’re
                            looking to optimize your fees, speed up transactions, or simply move your assets between
                            different blockchains, knowing how to swap tokens efficiently can save you both time and
                            money. Why token swapping is crucial in crypto At its core, token swapping is the process of
                            exchanging one cryptocurrency for another or even swapping the same token across different
                            networks. As more blockchains emerge, token swapping becomes increasingly important,
                            allowing users to seamlessly move assets across ecosystems. Whether you’re trying to switch
                            from USDT TRC20 to ERC20, or trading stablecoins like USDT for other assets like TRX, the
                            ability to move across networks is invaluable. But why does this matter? Lower fees: Some
                            blockchains, like Ethereum, are notorious for high gas fees during periods of congestion.
                            Swapping to another network, such as Tron, can help reduce these costs significantly. Faster
                            transactions: Different blockchains have varying transaction speeds. If you’re trying to
                            move quickly in a fast-paced market, a slow network can cost you valuable time. Swapping to
                            a faster blockchain can give you the edge you need. Access to different ecosystems: Each
                            blockchain has its own unique set of decentralized applications (dApps), staking
                            opportunities, and liquidity pools. By swapping tokens, you can access different ecosystems
                            and take advantage of their unique features. Swapping USDT TRC20 to ERC20 Suppose you’ve
                            been holding USDT on the Tron network (TRC20), but now you want to transfer it to the
                            Ethereum network (ERC20). Here’s a simple guide on how to do this: Find a reliable platform:
                            The first step is to choose a platform that supports cross-chain swaps. Popular exchanges
                            like LetsExchange, Binance, or KuCoin allow users to convert tokens from one network to
                            another seamlessly. Deposit USDT (TRC20): After selecting your platform, deposit your TRC20
                            USDT into your exchange wallet. Ensure that you choose the correct deposit network (TRC20)
                            to avoid losing your funds. Select the swap option: Once your USDT is in your wallet,
                            navigate to the token swap section. Choose to convert your USDT from TRC20 to ERC20.
                            Double-check all the details, including the amount and network, before confirming the
                            transaction. Receive USDT on ERC20: After the swap is complete, your USDT will now be
                            available on the Ethereum network. You can then transfer it to an ERC20-compatible wallet,
                            such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Exchanging USDT to TRX Another common scenario is when you
                            exchange USDT to TRX. Here’s how you can do that: Choose an exchange: Platforms like
                            Binance, LetsExchange, or Huobi allow users to exchange USDT for TRX. Make sure you select
                            an exchange that supports both tokens and offers favorable rates. Deposit USDT: Transfer
                            your USDT to the exchange. You can deposit either ERC20 or TRC20 USDT, depending on what the
                            exchange supports. Once your deposit is confirmed, the funds will be available for trading.
                            Trade USDT for TRX: Navigate to the USDT/TRX trading pair on your platform of choice. Enter
                            the amount of USDT you want to trade, and the platform will calculate how much TRX you’ll
                            receive based on the current market rate. Confirm and withdraw: Once you’ve executed the
                            trade, you can withdraw your TRX to a Tron-compatible wallet like TronLink. TRX is often
                            used for staking, governance, or simply participating in the Tron ecosystem. Final thoughts:
                            stay agile in the crypto ecosystem In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, flexibility
                            is key. Whether you’re swapping USDT TRC20 to ERC20, exchanging Tether for TRX, or moving
                            between other networks and tokens, being agile and understanding how to optimize your
                            transactions can save you both time and money. As more blockchains emerge and as the crypto
                            space becomes more interconnected, mastering token swaps will become an essential skill for
                            anyone involved in the market. So, stay informed, stay flexible, and take full advantage of
                            the possibilities that blockchain technology offers.

                    Bitcoin Rises 2% as US Job Data Offsets Middle East Concerns

                            The cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery after recent losses. Bitcoin gained
                            nearly 2% following the release of positive US employment data. Investors seemed to
                            momentarily set aside concerns about the Middle East situation. Iran’s launch of 200
                            missiles at Israel earlier this week sparked fears of a broader conflict. This event
                            initially triggered risk aversion in the markets. However, the crypto Fear & Greed Index
                            rose from 37 to 41 points, indicating a shift towards neutral territory. Around 10:28 AM
                            (Brasília time), Bitcoin traded at $61,500, up 1.7% in 24 hours. Ethereum’s Ether rose 1.2%
                            to $2,381. The total cryptocurrency market cap reached $2.24 trillion. In Brazilian reais,
                            Bitcoin appreciated 1.55% to R$337,843. Among altcoins, Solana (SOL) increased 3% to
                            $140.81. Binance Coin (BNB) rose 2% to $551.90. Avalanche (AVAX) surged 5.1% to $25.69.
                            These gains reflect a broader market recovery. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced a net
                            outflow of $54.2 million. This marked the third consecutive trading day with capital
                            outflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB led the withdrawals with $58 million in net sales. An analyst
                            from a major cryptocurrency exchange noted that selling pressure on cryptocurrencies remains
                            relatively low. Long-term investors and speculators are holding onto their coins for longer
                            periods. This behavior suggests growing confidence in the market. Another market expert
                            pointed out that global uncertainties drive investors to seek capital protection. Gold
                            remains a preferred safe-haven asset during such times. Cryptocurrencies often see rapid
                            capital outflows in these situations, increasing their volatility. The market’s response to
                            positive economic data highlights the complex factors influencing cryptocurrency prices.
                            This occurs amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Investors continue to balance growth
                            opportunities with risk management in this dynamic sector.

                    Mercado Bitcoin Partners with Ripple to Streamline International Transfers

                            Ripple, a leading digital asset infrastructure provider, has launched Ripple Payments in
                            Brazil. Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will be the first
                            Brazilian customer to use this solution. The service enables businesses to leverage
                            blockchain for faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions. Customers can
                            transfer funds globally 24/7, 365 days a year, with payments completed within minutes. This
                            development builds on features introduced last year, allowing Ripple to manage payments
                            end-to-end for its clients. Mercado Bitcoin will use ripple payments to enhance transactions
                            between Brazil and Portugal. In addition, the company plans to support international
                            payments for its customers in the future. A key feature is the use of a non-resident
                            account, allowing direct payments in Brazilian Reais. Brazil’s leading position in the
                            cryptocurrency market made it ideal for Ripple Payments’ expansion. Ripple opened a local
                            office in Brazil in 2019 and launched its first crypto-enabled payment solution with
                            Travelex Bank in 2022. Ripple Payments Expands in Brazil Ripple Payments offers Brazilian
                            businesses trust, security, streamlined onboarding, global access through a single
                            integration, and 24/7 liquidity in multiple currencies. It enables efficient transactions
                            regardless of destination or time zone. Silvio Pegado, Managing Director of LATAM at Ripple,
                            highlighted the solution’s ability to help crypto companies streamline operations and
                            improve margins. Jordan Abud, Head of Banking at Mercado Bitcoin, expressed enthusiasm for
                            the partnership. Ripple’s infrastructure positions it well to provide core services needed
                            by financial institutions, including tokenization, storage, exchange, and transfer of
                            digital assets. Ripple Payments covers over 80 payout markets, representing more than 90% of
                            daily foreign exchange markets. The company has over ten years of experience in digital
                            assets and holds more than 55 regulatory licenses across various jurisdictions. The first
                            operation will be institutional, exclusively from Mercado Bitcoin to Mercado Bitcoin
                            Portugal.

                    Coinbase to Remove Some Stablecoins in Europe Before New Regulations
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Coinbase has taken steps to delist certain stablecoins from its European platform as the
                            European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory deadline approaches. MiCA, which
                            was officially adopted in 2023, is set to introduce a sweeping regulatory framework aimed at
                            managing the cryptocurrency market within the EU. One of its key objectives is ensuring
                            transparency, consumer protection, and compliance, particularly in stablecoin issuance and
                            circulation. As a result, cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Europe, including Coinbase,
                            are preparing to comply with the regulatory standards that will come into effect in July
                            2024. Coinbase has confirmed that it will remove stablecoins that fail to meet the MiCA
                            requirements. These requirements set strict guidelines on asset reserves, issuance, and
                            accountability for stablecoin issuers. Notably, MiCA introduces a mandate that stablecoins
                            be backed by adequate reserves, with issuers needing to regularly report to regulators to
                            ensure market transparency and protect investors. Stablecoins that are non-compliant with
                            these guidelines will no longer be available on Coinbase’s European platform after the
                            regulations come into effect. The crypto exchange, which has been proactive in its approach
                            to regulatory frameworks, aims to maintain its European operations while ensuring full
                            compliance with local laws. MiCA is expected to have a profound impact on the broader
                            European cryptocurrency market, bringing stability but also posing challenges to some
                            digital assets and exchanges. By preparing in advance, Coinbase seeks to minimize
                            disruptions for its users and secure its position in the European crypto market under the
                            new regulatory landscape. MiCA’s emphasis on stablecoins stems from their role in providing
                            liquidity and facilitating transactions within the crypto ecosystem. However, their
                            decentralized nature has raised concerns among regulators regarding financial stability and
                            market manipulation. Stablecoins are pegged to traditional currencies or other assets, and
                            any instability or lack of proper backing could have significant ripple effects in both the
                            cryptocurrency and financial markets. MiCA aims to mitigate these risks by enforcing
                            stricter rules, requiring stablecoin issuers to disclose how they are backed and to prove
                            that adequate reserves are held. Coinbase’s decision to delist certain stablecoins has
                            sparked discussions about how exchanges will navigate the evolving regulatory environment.
                            The move to comply with MiCA is part of a broader trend in the crypto industry, as
                            businesses recognize the need to adapt to government oversight in a previously unregulated
                            space. Crypto markets across Europe are expected to see additional shifts in the coming
                            months as other exchanges may follow Coinbase’s lead. The stablecoin market has grown
                            significantly, with popular coins such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD
                            (BUSD) dominating trading volumes. However, MiCA’s framework will require these issuers to
                            provide detailed reports on how their stablecoins are collateralized. Coinbase has not
                            disclosed which specific stablecoins will be removed, but industry speculation points to
                            lesser-known tokens that may not be as well-capitalized or compliant with the new
                            regulations. This regulatory transition comes at a time when global regulators are paying
                            closer attention to cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. While the EU is leading the
                            charge with MiCA, other major economies are also grappling with how to integrate digital
                            assets into their existing financial systems. The regulatory pressure may lead to
                            consolidation in the stablecoin market, with only the most resilient and compliant tokens
                            surviving. Coinbase’s move aligns with its broader strategy of ensuring compliance across
                            its global operations. Earlier this year, the company faced regulatory challenges in the
                            U.S., where stablecoins have also come under scrutiny from agencies like the Securities and
                            Exchange Commission (SEC). These regulatory developments underscore the growing focus on
                            governance and transparency in the cryptocurrency space, as governments seek to protect
                            investors and maintain financial stability in an increasingly digital economy.

                            The number of cryptocurrencies continues to explode. In 2023 more than 9,000 coins but some
                            estimates put the total number of cryptocurrencies closer to 20,000, but a significant
                            portion of these are inactive or no longer being used. The ease with which new
                            cryptocurrencies can be created, mainly thanks to open-source blockchain technology,
                            contributes to this high number. The top 20 cryptocurrencies dominate the market, accounting
                            for nearly 90% of the total value. Creating a cryptocurrency is relatively accessible to
                            anyone with programming skills and knowledge of blockchain technology. Existing platforms
                            such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain provide readily available infrastructure for
                            developing and deploying new cryptocurrencies, often with smart contracts within
                            Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. This accessibility has led to the emergence of
                            various cryptocurrencies, some focused on real payment challenges, while others have been
                            created with speculative profit motives. The landscape of cryptocurrencies is characterized
                            by a wide range of categories. In addition to “meme coins” such as Dogecoin, which has its
                            origins in a funny concept, other types include altcoins, utility tokens, governance tokens
                            and stablecoins. Altcoins generally refer to cryptocurrencies created after Bitcoin, the
                            first digital currency. Utility tokens and governance tokens often find applications within
                            Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse. For example, the MANA cryptocurrency
                            facilitates real estate transactions within the Decentraland metaverse. Stablecoins, such as
                            Tether, are linked to a tangible asset such as the US dollar, with the goal of minimizing
                            price volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies. Business AM Read More: crypto

                            As the crypto market grows, businesses and individual users look for tools that simplify
                            transactions, enhance interoperability, and speed up processes. Bitget is taking a major
                            step by launching a $20 million fund to support the growth of the TON ecosystem. Meanwhile,
                            the SUI Bridge enhances cross-chain asset transfers between Sui and Ethereum. However, one
                            of the top crypto tools right now is Plus Wallet. It offers unique features, including
                            effortless crypto invoicing and fast token listings, making it ideal for businesses that
                            adopt crypto. With these capabilities, Plus Wallet is a strong MetaMask alternative for
                            individual users and businesses. Bitget Funds $20M Initiative to Expand the TON Ecosystem A
                            recent announcement revealed that Bitget has launched a $20 million fund to support the
                            growth of the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem. This initiative is designed to enhance the
                            TON blockchain’s utility by investing in projects focused on decentralised applications,
                            smart contracts, and blockchain-based solutions that integrate with Telegram’s vast user
                            base. The Bitget fund holds significant potential to spur innovation within the ecosystem.
                            Its success will rely on the careful selection of impactful projects and the ability to
                            navigate the evolving regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies and decentralised
                            finance. SUI Bridge Launches Cross-Chain Asset Transfers The SUI Bridge has officially
                            launched on the Mainnet, securing assets’ transfers between the Sui and Ethereum
                            blockchains. It allows users to move ETH and WETH seamlessly across ecosystems by providing
                            a trust-minimized solution for cross-chain functionality. This native bridging tool is

                            for users to navigate decentralized applications and DeFi. While only ETH and WETH are
                            currently supported, future updates are expected to expand asset compatibility, allowing for
                            broader integration within the Sui network and beyond. Plus Wallet’s Effortless Invoicing &

                    Upcoming Bitcoin Documentary Reignites Mystery Over Creator's Identity

                            An upcoming HBO documentary hints at revealing the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the
                            unknown creator of Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency."If he is an individual rather
                            than a collective, he could be one of the richest people on earth," the trailer for the HBO
                            documentary teases.The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the biggest
                            mysteries in the tech world, and despite numerous investigations and claims, no conclusive
                            evidence has emerged to identify Bitcoin's creator."Anyone competent enough to go do Bitcoin
                            probably would be competent enough to not leave any traces," says one of the interviewees in
                            the HBO trailer.In 2008, a person or group using this name published a whitepaper titled
                            "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," which outlined the concept of the digital
                            currency. Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software in 2009 and collaborated with other
                            developers on the project until 2010.In 2011, Nakamoto ceased communication with the Bitcoin
                            community and essentially vanished.Many individuals have been proposed or have claimed to be
                            Satoshi Nakamoto. These include Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist and
                            cryptographer, Hal Finney, an early Bitcoin contributor who passed away in 2014, Craig
                            Wright, an Australian computer scientist who publicly claimed to be Nakamoto (though this
                            claim is widely disputed), and Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man who was mistakenly
                            identified as the Bitcoin creator in 2014.A significant number of bitcoins (estimated to be
                            around 1 million) believed to belong to Nakamoto remain unspent, adding to the mystery.
                            "Satoshi's done nothing to speak for his stash," says one of the documentary
                            interviewees.The documentary, titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, is directed by
                            Emmy-nominated Cullen Hoback, who also directed and produced the HBO documentary series Q:
                            Into the Storm, which investigated the origins and impact of the QAnon conspiracy theory
                            movement. The Bitcoin documentary airs on October 8.Not everyone is convinced the film will
                            put the Bitcoin mystery to rest. "SPOILER ALERT. HBO has no idea who is Satoshi Nakamoto.
                            You're welcome," said one individual on X (formerly Twitter).Crypto trading platform
                            Coinbase posted in response to the trailer: "We are all Satoshi. Roll credits."Others feel
                            more hopeful. "A new HBO documentary claims to have cracked the true identity of the
                            pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto," posted crypto resources platform Unusual
                            Whales."It says that 'its findings will shock the world, even the US election'," it
                            added.Some key Bitcoin statistics: Bitcoin's market cap is around $1.3 trillion as of
                            September 2024, according to Statista; Bitcoin's price hovers between $60,000 and $65,000;
                            The total circulating supply is approximately 19.76 million Bitcoins, as per Blockchain.com.
                            This is based on Bitcoin's fixed maximum supply of 21 million; Bitcoin processes about
                            300,000 to 350,000 transactions per day; Bitcoin's annual energy consumption is estimated at
                            176 TWh, which is higher than the consumption of several countries including Egypt and
                            Malaysia, as noted by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

                    Binance’s Crypto Dominance Sees Significant Decline Amidst Falling Trading Volumes
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Binance, once the dominant force in cryptocurrency exchanges, has witnessed a sharp fall in
                            its market share, marking a four-year low as of September 2024. This decline is coupled with
                            a notable drop in trading volumes, with figures indicating a contraction of over 20%
                            compared to the previous month. The exchange’s declining influence underscores broader
                            market dynamics that are reshaping the competitive landscape of digital assets trading. As
                            of September, Binance’s market share slipped to approximately 34%, a significant decline
                            from the 50% it commanded earlier in the year. The company’s dwindling dominance has raised
                            questions about its long-term strategy and its ability to maintain its foothold in a market
                            that is becoming increasingly fragmented. Several factors have contributed to Binance’s
                            drop, including regulatory pressures, legal challenges, and the emergence of rival platforms
                            that are capitalizing on the exchange’s setbacks. Binance’s struggle is further exacerbated
                            by the global regulatory environment, which has been tightening around the exchange.
                            Multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, have introduced or expanded
                            regulations aimed at increasing oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges. In particular,
                            Binance has faced scrutiny from authorities over concerns surrounding compliance with
                            anti-money laundering (AML) rules, as well as issues related to Know Your Customer (KYC)
                            requirements. These challenges have resulted in some users migrating to alternative
                            platforms that are seen as more compliant or less prone to legal uncertainties. Despite
                            these obstacles, Binance continues to be a major player in the crypto space. Its diverse
                            offerings, including a wide array of digital assets and its established reputation, still
                            attract a substantial user base. However, the exchange has been forced to adapt to changing
                            conditions, implementing new policies aimed at addressing regulatory concerns. These
                            measures, while necessary, have also created friction with some users who prefer the more
                            relaxed regulatory environment that Binance originally thrived in. Rival exchanges such as
                            OKX and Bybit have gained ground, seizing the opportunity to attract traders dissatisfied
                            with Binance’s regulatory troubles. OKX, in particular, has seen its market share rise,
                            largely driven by its appeal to institutional investors and its regulatory standing in key
                            regions. Bybit, on the other hand, has capitalized on its innovative product offerings,
                            particularly in derivatives trading, which has drawn significant trading volume away from
                            Binance. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have surged in popularity as a viable alternative to
                            traditional, centralized platforms like Binance. DEXs offer users the ability to trade
                            directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries, providing an additional
                            layer of privacy and security that centralized exchanges sometimes struggle to offer.
                            Uniswap and other DEXs have seen an uptick in usage, contributing to the redistribution of
                            market share across the broader crypto ecosystem. The overall cryptocurrency market has also
                            been experiencing reduced trading activity, which has affected not just Binance but the
                            industry as a whole. Lower volatility in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
                            has led to a decrease in speculative trading, which typically drives much of the volume on
                            exchanges. As a result, Binance’s reliance on high trading volumes has placed it in a
                            vulnerable position during periods of market stagnation. The exchange’s response to these
                            challenges will likely determine its ability to regain market share. Binance has already
                            made efforts to bolster its reputation and restore confidence, including expanding its
                            regulatory compliance team and forging partnerships with regulators to create a more
                            transparent operational environment. Nevertheless, with its trading volume plunging and
                            competitors gaining traction, Binance’s path forward remains uncertain. One of the more
                            notable trends influencing Binance’s decline is the growing interest in institutional
                            cryptocurrency trading. Institutional players have become more active in the space, seeking
                            exchanges that can provide robust compliance frameworks, secure trading environments, and
                            advanced features suited to their needs. Binance, despite its size and market share, has
                            struggled to fully cater to these demands, creating an opening for more niche,
                            institution-focused platforms to thrive. Binance’s founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has
                            maintained a bullish stance on the future of the company, pointing to its innovation
                            pipeline and its commitment to working with regulators. He has stressed the exchange’s focus
                            on creating a sustainable ecosystem that will benefit both retail and institutional traders.
                            However, the company’s future success will largely depend on how well it navigates the
                            complex regulatory landscape and adapts to the evolving needs of its users.

                    Lakers' JJ Redick: 'Surreal' to See LeBron, Bronny James Practicing Together in NBA
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Now that the Los Angeles Lakers have officially opened training camp, LeBron and Bronny
                            James are getting their first formal taste of working together as teammates. Lakers head
                            coach JJ Redick told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne about the "surreal" experience of seeing the
                            father-son duo playing on the court with each other: "I mean, you get to coach your own kids
                            when they're little. But he's in the freaking NBA, shooting right over here on this basket
                            with his son. ... They were doing 2-on-2 pick-and-roll drills to start practice against the
                            coaches. One of them's guarding the ball. One of them's guarding the screener. It's
                            surreal." The Lakers began practicing on Tuesday, with Bronny apparently taking it to his
                            father when they were matched up with each other on the second day of camp. Anthony Davis
                            told ESPN's Dave McMenamin on Wednesday the 19-year-old rookie hit a three over LeBron that
                            seemed to light a fire under the four-time NBA MVP. "Everybody was talking smack in Bronny's
                            favor," Davis said. "Then Bron came down and just bullied somebody. Just took it out on [the
                            defender] —I forgot who it was—and got a layup. Bronny came down and hit another 3, I think
                            over Austin [Reaves]. And Bron wanted the ball." Bronny's role with the Lakers is still
                            being determined, but Redick previously said on The Lowe Post podcast (starts at 1:03:51
                            mark) that he and LeBron will play together in the same game "sooner rather than later." In
                            the same interview, Redick suggested Bronny could spend time with the South Bay Lakers in
                            the G League because of the development they need to see from his game. There is a chance
                            fans could see LeBron and Bronny playing together as soon as Friday night. The Lakers open
                            their preseason schedule against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Acrisure Arena in Phoenix.
                            Redick confirmed on Thursday that LeBron and Davis will get some playing time in the
                            preseason opener. The Lakers will also host the Timberwolves in the regular-season opener
                            for both teams on Oct. 22 at Crypto.com Arena.

                    Coinbase to delist some stablecoins in Europe ahead of new regulations
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Coinbase will delist certain stablecoins in the European Economic Area by year's end, the
                            cryptocurrency exchange said on Friday, as the industry braces for tougher regulation in the
                            region. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in
                            Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, introduced in early 2023, is set to be fully applied by
                            December. It requires issuers of stablecoins - crypto tokens whose monetary value is pegged
                            to a stable asset to protect from wild volatility - to meet strict transparency, liquidity,
                            and consumer protection standards. "Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to
                            restrict the provision of services to EEA users in connection with stablecoins that do not
                            meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024," the top U.S. crypto exchange said in an
                            emailed statement. Coinbase plans to offer in November impacted EEA customers options to
                            switch to authorized issuers like fintech firm Circle's USDC and EURC, whose value is pegged
                            to the U.S. dollar and euro, respectively. Stablecoins have gained significant popularity in
                            recent years, as financial heavyweights such as PayPal adopt them and the rapid integration
                            into mainstream finance of the once-nascent digital assets sector.

                    New HBO Doc Promises to Unmask the Mysterious Inventor of Bitcoin
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The world has long wondered who created Bitcoin. Ever since a white paper bearing his name
                            was published on the web in 2008, the digital asset’s conception has widely been attributed
                            to a pseudonymous figure known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Still, nobody knows who Satoshi is—or
                            if it’s even a single person. Now, a new documentary from HBO promises to dox the
                            long-secret identity of the supposed crypto mastermind. Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery
                            is directed by Cullen Hoback, the same filmmaker who took on the mysterious personality
                            behind the QAnon cult in Q: Enter the Storm, another HBO doc. Having allegedly cracked that
                            case, Hoback seems to be trying his luck with yet another long-simmering mystery: the
                            identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. A newly released trailer for the film doesn’t give much away
                            but promises another interesting ride. Hoback seems to have sketched out a compelling thesis
                            for Q’s identity in Into the Storm, but he never got the culprit dead to rights. His
                            documentary points the finger at Ron Watkins, a weirdo systems administrator for 8kun (the
                            follow-up site to 4chan, where Q originally began his posting career). Since the documentary
                            was released, Q’s activity has mostly quieted down. It will be interesting to see if Hoback
                            validates a long prevailing theory, which is that Bitcoin wasn’t created by an individual at
                            all, but by a government agency—namely, the Central Intelligence Agency. Tucker Carlson, who
                            has never met a conspiracy theory he didn’t like, recently platformed this theory on his
                            dumb podcast. (Carlson said it was “obvious” that the CIA created the digital currency and
                            that it was a “honeytrap.”) This is a believable hypothesis but one that involves little
                            evidence. Purveyors of the “CIA invented Bitcoin” theory have relied heavily on the argument
                            that Satoshi Nakamoto translates (roughly) to “central” “intelligence,” in Japanese. Others
                            contend that the National Security Agency is Bitcoin’s progenitor—a guess that, frankly,
                            makes a lot more sense. After all, crypto is conjured via cryptography, and the NSA, which
                            employs more mathematicians than any other organization on the planet, is the world’s
                            premier cryptography organization. Why would America’s intelligence services want to create
                            fake internet money to compete with the dollar? Your guess is as good as mine. If you listen
                            to Russian state media, they’ll tell you that it was invented to generate funds for American
                            covert operations overseas, which, despite being a conjecture spawned by our geopolitical
                            enemy, is as good a theory as any. Money Electric will be available on Max starting October
                            8.

                            They say pressure makes diamonds. VCs are probably hoping the same is true for startups
                            launching and operating in this tough economy.Fintech funding, measured across average deal
                            size and deal volume, fell from 2023 levels, according to CB Insights' second-quarter State
                            of Fintech report.Still, VCs are finding bright spots in the sector. Business Insider asked
                            27 top investors — including Index Ventures, QED Investors, and Bain Capital Ventures — to
                            name some of those diamonds in the rough. In total, they named 49 red-hot startups that
                            haven't raised beyond a Series C, including companies within their portfolios and those with
                            which they have no financial ties.AI fintechs dominated the series this year, using the tech
                            to do everything from helping dealmakers negotiate debt agreements to automating compliance
                            for fintechs and banks, and helping consumers strategize around their debts. Fintechs
                            disrupting the insurance and healthcare industries were also popular. And some VCs are
                            excited about startups using crypto's behind-the-scenes tech, like stablecoins and
                            blockchain, to streamline money movement.

                    IMF Pushes El Salvador To Narrow Bitcoin Law For Funding
                </h3>

                            SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR - JUNE 1: In this handout picture provided by the Salvadoran
                            presidency, ... [+] President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele takes oath of office during the
                            'Inauguration Day ' at Palacio Nacional on June 1, 2024 in San Salvador, El Salvador. Nayib
                            Bukele won the presidential election on February 4 giving him a second consecutive term in
                            office from 2024 to 2029. (Photo by Handout/Getty Images) Getty Images The International
                            Monetary Fund stated that if El Salvador doesn’t get rid of its Bitcoin Bitcoin law, which
                            made bitcoin legal tender in the country, it should at least “narrow the scope” of the
                            regulation to receive the resources from the fund it seeks. El Salvador made bitcoin legal
                            tender in 2021, and since that moment, the IMF has been criticizing and opposing this
                            decision. Now, they come with a different approach: equally against bitcoin but with a less
                            challenging claim. “What we have recommended is a narrowing of the scope of the Bitcoin law,
                            strengthening the regulatory framework and oversight of the Bitcoin ecosystem and limiting
                            the public sector exposure to bitcoin,” the IMF’s Director of Communications Department
                            Julie Kozack explained in a press briefing on October 3. The Central American country not
                            only declared bitcoin legal tender but also created regulations regarding digital assets in
                            general, and have been accumulating bitcoin. Right now, El Salvador sits on 5,892.76 BTC,
                            adding 1 BTC daily to its treasury as a public policy since November 2022; President Nayib
                            Bukele announced this strategy through his X account. Even being an important demand from
                            the IMF, the new comments underscore the shift in the fund’s narrative. In 2021, its
                            representatives called for the full abolition of the law. The idea is that the country
                            should limit the influence of bitcoin, especially in the public sector, as Kozack stated.
                            That’s a change. Read More: Venezuelans Use Crypto To Resist Maduro’s Post-Election
                            Repression “Bitcoin is a mimetic money machine. If the IMF and the other fiat supranationals
                            do not accumulate a stash, they will go extinct,” said the Bitcoin analyst and Adamant
                            Research founder Tuur Demeester through his X account, implying that, in the end,
                            organizations like the IMF might be forced to accumulate Bitcoin. Despite looking for
                            resources, El Salvador’s president announced that the national budget 2025 won’t include the
                            issuance of new debt, so they may be prepared for not receiving new funds from the IMF. The
                            conversations continue, and now it’s time for the El Salvador administration to choose if
                            they prefer the fund way or keep on track with their Bitcoin strategy. The country has been
                            exploring the possibility of issuing bonds related to Bitcoin, known as the Volcano Bonds,
                            since 2021, so there are alternatives to finance the funding needed. We contacted several
                            organizations related to the El Salvador government but had yet to receive an answer by the
                            time of this publication.
