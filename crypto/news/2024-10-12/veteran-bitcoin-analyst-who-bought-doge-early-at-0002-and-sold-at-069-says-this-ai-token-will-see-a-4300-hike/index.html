The Bitcoin Analyst Focus: The Meme That Made Millions

It took time for the Dogecoin price to rise and provide massive returns from a meme to a major crypto movement. In 2017, it remained around $0.0002, nearly forgotten by most.

They made enormous riches off of little investments, and they enjoyed phenomenal returns.
