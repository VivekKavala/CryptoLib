Off The Gird is the hit new game.
Credit: Gunzilla Games

Off The Gird is seemingly the latest almost unknown game to find a massive audience after launching, thanks to some smart Twitch campaigns featuring massive streamers and the fact it is pretty fun to play. However, what a lot of those streamers are not telling you is that this is actually a crypto based game that plans to add NFTs in the future; but that may not be a bad thing.

Off The Grid is a brand-new Early Access battle royale shooter that has some extraction shooter mechanics thrown in, effectively making it a bit of a cross between Apex Legends and Escape From Tarkov. For a game pretty much no one had head about before it launched into Early Access this week, it’s surprisingly good, with some fun shooting mechanics and excellent movement.

It’s far from perfect, with a few weird design choices, such as the very thin map and the lack of any real visual feedback when you get shot, but those are things that could be fixed reasonably easily to potential make Off The Grid the next big battle royale.

A partnership with streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, who has his own skin in the game, and ad deals with lots of other big names have seen Off The Grid become one of the most streamed games on Twitch in recent days, with hundreds of thousands of players tuning in. It’s also hit the top 12 most played games on the Epic Games Store, beating out the likes of PUBG, League of Legends and Rainbow Six Siege.

However, one thing that is seemingly being kept quiet is that Off The Grid is a blockchain based game, with plans to add NFTs and implement a crypto based marketplace in the future.

So far the crypto functionality is missing, and given the somewhat unexpected success it wouldn’t be surprised if it was delayed significantly down the line to not alienate the audience, who typically have a poor view of crypto in games.

However, the way the dev team has spoken about the implementation in the past doesn’t sound terrible. In fact, it sounds just like the way the Steam Marketplace works for Counter-Strike and similar games, just with the transactions taking place on the blockchain. Given that it’s possible to cash out your Steam balance through third party sites and CS skins, the functionally would basically be exactly the same with the proposed blockchain implementation in Off The Gird, and you wouldn’t have to use a shady trading site to do it.

There have been some truly awful cash grabs in the world of crypto games, but this doesn’t sound like one, and most importantly, there is a fun, entirely free to play, game beneath it, with the blockchain stuff seemingly coming as a totally optional extra. There will no doubt be some backlash when these features are added, but to me at least, it seems like this is a crypto game that could work.

                            The Internet Archive is under attack. On top of multiple extinction-threatening lawsuits against the organization that created and maintains the Wayback Machine, hackers this week breached the Internet Archive, stole 31 million user account details, and defaced its website—all while archive.org struggled to stay online thanks to a barrage of distributed denial-of-service attacks. As of Friday, the site remained “temporarily offline.”
In a dark twist of fate, a judge this week cleared the way for the US Treasury Department to take possession of 69,000 bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road dark web market; meanwhile, the former IRS investigator who personally seized the bitcoins, Tigran Gambaryan, remains in a Nigerian jail cell on charges related to the actions of his current employer, embattled crypto exchange Binance. Members of Congress and other officials have called for the US government to do more to ensure Gambaryan’s release given his direct role in a series of major criminal cases and in pioneering crypto-investigation techniques. As for those seized Silk Road bitcoins, they are now worth $4.4 billion and will likely be auctioned off.
Security researchers this week detailed a pernicious malware that worms its way into Linux machines and uses a variety of techniques to evade detection. Dubbed Perfctl, the malware hides itself by creating files that match those typically found within Linux instances, using tricks to prevent admin tools from recording its activities, and more. All of this is done with the goal of remaining on an infected machine to keep carrying out a variety of malicious activities. Researchers estimate that millions of Linux devices could be vulnerable.

The FBI Made a Crypto Coin Just to Catch Fraudsters
Police use of honeypots to catch cybercriminals red-handed is nothing new. But creating an entirely new cryptocurrency to catch pump-and-dump schemers? Now that’s something special. The US Department of Justice revealed this week that the FBI made a new Ethereum-based crypto token, NexFundAI, specifically to trick people who manipulate crypto markets and take them down.
While the investigation ultimately resulted in charges against 18 people and other entities for alleged fraud and crypto market manipulation, the blast radius of the scheme also impacted some regular retail investors who are not accused of any crimes, although US officials did not provide details about those investments. A US prosecutor involved in the case told reporters, however, that the investigation netted a total of $25 million in funds, which will be returned to investors. Trading on NexFundAI has since been disabled.
National Public Data Files for Bankruptcy After Catastrophic Breach
National Public Data, a data broker based in Florida, is having a bad year. In August, hackers published 2.9 billion records stolen from NPD last December that included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and Social Security numbers—a giant trove the hackers claim impacted “the entire population of USA, CA, and UK.” Then came the inevitable lawsuits against NPD, which is now filing for bankruptcy. Those proceedings have revealed new details, including the fact that NPD is run by a single person, Salvatore Verini, Jr, who operated the business out of his home on around $2,500 worth of equipment. A document filed in a bankruptcy court by one of NPD’s debtors states that the breach may have impacted “hundreds of millions” of people.
Russia and Turkey Block Discord
Discord users in Russia and Turkey this week found they were suddenly unable to connect to the online chat application. Authorities in both countries later revealed that Discord had been blocked for allegedly facilitating illegal activity. Russia’s internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement the block “is necessary to prevent the use of the messenger for terrorist and extremist purposes, the recruitment of citizens for their commission, the sale of drugs, in connection with the placement of illegal information.” Turkish authorities, meanwhile, banned the messaging app after a court decision involving child abuse material that was allegedly hosted on Discord servers. According to BleepingComputer, some Discord users in those countries were able to access the app using a VPN that routed their connections through foreign IP addresses—potentially good news for Russian troops who were reportedly disrupted by the block.
Police Secretly Use Face Recognition Tech to Link People to Crimes
Law enforcement use of face recognition technology to pin crimes on Americans is far more widespread than previously known, according to a newly published investigation by The Washington Post. Records obtained by the Post found that police in 15 states used face recognition tools in “more than 1,000 investigations over the past four years.” Despite its apparent widespread use, police departments frequently seek to hide their use of the technology, which has been found to inaccurately identify people who are then charged with crimes they did not commit. As an assistant public defender in Minnesota told Post reporters, police likely obscure their use of face recognition because they “want to avoid the litigation surrounding reliability of the technology.”

                    OKX Transforming Dubai’s Cryptocurrency Landscape with Exchange Launch
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            OKX, one of the leading global cryptocurrency exchanges, has officially launched its services in Dubai, marking a significant development in the emirate’s burgeoning digital asset market. The exchange’s entry into this region is seen as a strategic move to enhance its presence in the Middle East and cater to the growing demand for cryptocurrency trading. This initiative aligns with Dubai’s ambitions to become a global hub for fintech and blockchain technologies.

The newly launched exchange offers a comprehensive suite of services, including spot and derivatives trading, which allows users to trade a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a wide range of altcoins. As part of its commitment to user security and regulatory compliance, OKX has implemented robust security measures and enhanced verification processes tailored to meet local regulatory requirements. This move is expected to bolster user confidence and attract a broader user base in the region.

Dubai has emerged as a favorable environment for cryptocurrency enterprises due to its progressive regulatory framework and government support for blockchain innovation. The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which has developed a dedicated Crypto Centre, has been instrumental in creating an ecosystem conducive to crypto businesses. With the establishment of its exchange, OKX aims to capitalize on this supportive infrastructure and the increasing interest in digital assets among retail and institutional investors.

Industry analysts view the entrance of OKX into Dubai as a game-changer in the local cryptocurrency landscape. The exchange’s global reputation and extensive experience in the digital asset space position it well to compete with other established platforms. According to recent reports, the demand for cryptocurrency trading in the Middle East has surged, driven by a youthful population eager to explore investment opportunities in digital currencies. OKX’s offerings are expected to cater to this demographic while also attracting seasoned traders looking for a reliable and feature-rich trading platform.

OKX is committed to educational initiatives aimed at fostering a better understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology among potential users. The exchange plans to launch various educational programs, webinars, and workshops designed to equip users with the knowledge and skills necessary for safe and effective trading. This focus on education is part of a broader strategy to demystify cryptocurrencies and encourage responsible investment practices.

In addition to its trading services, OKX aims to offer a suite of advanced trading tools and features, such as algorithmic trading, margin trading, and staking options. These tools are designed to enhance the trading experience and provide users with various ways to maximize their investments. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the introduction of such features will likely attract a diverse range of traders, from novices to experienced investors.

Competition in the UAE’s cryptocurrency market is heating up, with several exchanges vying for market share. Binance, FTX, and BitOasis are among the other prominent players that have established a presence in the region. Each platform offers unique features and services, creating a dynamic landscape for cryptocurrency trading. The entry of OKX is expected to intensify this competition, leading to better services and lower fees for users, which will ultimately benefit the growing number of investors in the region.

As digital currencies gain acceptance and regulatory frameworks evolve, the potential for further growth in the Middle East’s cryptocurrency market is immense. The UAE government has been proactive in establishing a regulatory framework that encourages innovation while ensuring investor protection. The recent introduction of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) regulations reflects this approach, providing clarity and guidelines for cryptocurrency operators. OKX’s adherence to these regulations signals its commitment to compliance and operational integrity.

Looking ahead, the future of cryptocurrency trading in Dubai appears promising. With the launch of its exchange, OKX aims to not only facilitate trading but also contribute to the broader fintech ecosystem in the region. The exchange is exploring partnerships with local businesses and financial institutions to enhance its service offerings and foster a collaborative environment for crypto innovation.

The exchange is leveraging Dubai’s strategic location as a gateway to other markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and beyond. By positioning itself in Dubai, OKX is strategically placed to attract users from neighboring countries, tapping into a larger pool of potential customers eager to explore the benefits of cryptocurrency trading.

                    Veteran Bitcoin Analyst Who Bought DOGE Early At $0.002 And Sold At $0.69 Says This AI Token Will See A 4,300% Hike
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Envision yourself as the knowledgeable investor who bought crypto with a Dogecoin price at $0.002 and sold it for $0.69, generating an attractive profit on your little investment. That is the narrative of a seasoned Bitcoin analyst, and they are currently creating waves once more with a bold new prediction. They have WallitIQ (WLTQ), an AI token that is expected to have a 4,300% hike, in their sights this time.

4,300% Growth Potential: How WallitIQ(WLTQ) Could Redefine The Market

WallitIQ (WLTQ) is causing waves in crypto with a 4,300% hike projection. A seasoned Bitcoin analyst who predicted Dogecoin price ascent from $0.002 to $0.69, made this remarkable rise prediction. This expert believes WallitIQ(WLTQ), a decentralized digital currency wallet driven by AI and Machine Learning, will be the next big thing. WallitIQ(WLTQ) is being called the asset to watch since it addresses the biggest issues of current crypto consumers.

WallitIQ (WLTQ) distinguishes out in today’s congested industry by combining AI with decentralized finance for a smooth and safe user experience. Its AI-driven biometric and face verification, predictive analytics, and automated portfolio management help customers remain ahead of the market. Real-time sentiment analysis and AI-powered trading methods let users make wiser, data-driven decisions that might unleash the tremendous growth potential many experts predict.

WallitIQ(WLTQ) helps crypto investors maximize their portfolio by optimizing the user interface and delivering smart staking and trading data. With the Bitcoin analyst who predicted dogecoin price spectacular climb now emphasizing WallitIQ(WLTQ) as the next crypto hit, a 4,300% hike in the market is expected.

WallitIQ(WLTQ) revolutionizes crypto interaction by making it accessible, secure, and intelligent. Escrow Connect, configurable warnings, and 24/7 AI chatbots provide next-gen security and a straightforward user experience. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is more than just a crypto token—it’s a strong solution driving the future of decentralized finance, and if the analyst’s predictions come true, a 4,300% hike might be only the beginning of its adverse impact.

The Bitcoin Analyst Focus: The Meme That Made Millions

It took time for the Dogecoin price to rise and provide massive returns from a meme to a major crypto movement. In 2017, it remained around $0.0002, nearly forgotten by most. However, all of that changed in 2021 when Dogecoin price skyrocketed to $0.73 because of the influence of people like Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. Dogecoin price increased by 50% in a matter of hours after he called it “the people’s cryptocurrency” in a tweet on February 4, 2021. This was a winning moment for astute investors, such as one seasoned Bitcoin analyst who purchased when the Dogecoin price was $0.002 and sold it for $0.69. They made enormous riches off of little investments, and they enjoyed phenomenal returns.

Ready To Experience 4,300% Hike: Secret Revealed

The success of Crypto by the bitcoin analyst goes beyond Dogecoin price prediction. The same expert is now causing waves once more with his prediction that WallitIQ (WLTQ), a decentralized cryptocurrency wallet driven by AI, is going to experience a 4,300% hike. They have their sights set on WallitIQ(WLTQ), advising that it will be the next big thing in the crypto world after profiting from the ascent of dogecoin price. With its emphasis on security, user experience, and financial empowerment, together with its state-of-the-art AI and machine learning technology, WallitIQ(WLTQ) is positioned to be a game-changer in the market.

The lead Bitcoin analyst who profited from Dogecoin price rise from $0.002 to $0.69 predicts a 4,300% hike for the AI-powered decentralized wallet WallitIQ (WLTQ). WallitIQ(WLTQ) might represent the next major crypto opportunity due to its focus on security, user experience, and cutting-edge AI technology. If the bitcoin analyst Dogecoin price prediction track record is any indication, this may be your chance to invest in the next crypto wave.

Regular readers will know that I travel a lot, always with a preference for boats and trains and by air when necessary. Having spent much of the summer without the need for a plane, the next few months will see an intensification of my travel schedule across Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

In most places I will be talking about the economics and politics of a changing world, but the virtue of visiting so many cities (Hamburg to Abu Dhabi for instance) and regions (the Cotswolds to South East Asia) is the opportunity it grants to witness the kinds of growth and development happening in the world, and the measures we can use to compare economic activity across countries.

Here, a few favourites come to mind. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s it was commonplace for economists and investment strategists in the large banks to rush back from trips to Asia with tales of how many cranes they had seen across the skylines of major Chinese cities and estimates of what this meant for the growth of the Chinese economy. Nowadays, those economists sit on a deck chair in the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore, look out onto the bay and count the number of tankers anchored there as a proxy for global supply chain disruption.

Another tell-tale indicator is taxis. A former colleague, friend and reader of this note, with whom I used to travel to Japan in the late 1990’s referenced the length of taxi queues as a proxy for Japan’s then moribund economy (often unoccupied taxi ranks would snake around office blocks).

Then on a visit to a thriving Abu Dhabi in 2012, my taxi driver got lost (on the way to the airport). He apologised, saying it was his ‘first day’. I assumed he meant it was his first day as a taxi driver, but it turned out that it was his first day in Abu Dhabi. I politely took this as a sign of a vibrant labour market and a strong economy.

A risk that travelling economists face, not unwittingly, is that they normally stay in the centre of a city, and often in a decent hotel. I wrote a note some time ago describing this as ‘Grande Bretagne’ syndrome, after the teams from the IMF who oversaw the austerity programme of the Greek economy during the euro-zone financial crisis who stayed in the plush Grande Bretagne and Hilton hotels in the city centre. While this placed them near the seat of power, it meant that they were blind to the brutal impact of austerity across the country.

In general, travelling economists should get out and about. For instance, the quality of public transport in a country is a good indicator of the standard of infrastructure and to an extent, social cohesion and, is also a good way to observe a society. Someone observed that a city in which the wealthy use public transport is a well-balanced one (Zurich is a good example). In contrast, there is, inexplicably, no train from Dublin airport to the city centre, but a ride on the Luas tram will give a very good idea of the dramatic changes in Irish society.

In keeping with this approach, a favourite activity to beat jetlag and to either reacquaint with or discover a city is an early morning run (this week’s schedule took in the Tour Eiffel, the Tiergarten and Madrid (the park was closed due to bad weather)). In that idiosyncratic way, My eyes (and feet) are sensitive to the quality of the road surface, pollution and to the appearance of new buildings and signs of dereliction (Berlin scores on both counts).

There are other indicators of the economic prowess of cities, such as the rise of tall towers (the UAE
iShares MSCI UAE Capped ETF
for instance). In this tech driven age, a new category of indicators might comprise cities that want to become crypto-hubs (UAE, Miami, Zurich, Lisbon) and those that seek to attract large artificial intelligence (AI) firms (OpenAI has just opened an office in Paris).

As a final note on Madrid, I haven't seen the city as ‘sleek’ or well presented (the 12th was the national holiday), and it must be said, as expensive. Note that Spain now has a slightly lower interest rate (bond yield) than France, and a considerably higher rate of growth than Germany.

The economy appears strong, despite concerns that many people versed about the state of Spanish democracy and its finely balanced political situation – there is likely a contentious budget on the horizon towards 2025.

There were a lot more Latin Americans than I had expected, and this has both helped tourism, and pushed up house prices (to the ire of some locals). Spain’s golden visa system means that it is the recipient of wealthier Latin Americans leaving countries like Venezuela. At the same time, quite a number of Spanish businesses and executives are relocating to Lisbon, which is a warning sign for innovation.

has swung wildly this week as analysts warn "something's got to give."

The bitcoin price has rebounded back above $60,000 per bitcoin from a crash at the beginning of the week even as JPMorgan analysts quietly predict a so-called "debasement trade" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election.

Now, after the mystery of bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto took a surprise turn, Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, has revealed the company's endgame is to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.

Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, has transformed the software company into a ... [+] bitcoin-buying vehicle, riding a bitcoin price boom.

"[Bitcoin] is the most valuable asset in the world," Saylor, who began buy bitcoin at the software-turned-bitcoin acquisition vehicle in 2020, told Bernstein analysts in an interview it was revealed by Bernstein digital asset lead Gautam Chhugani in a note to clients seen by The Block.

"The endgame is to be the leading bitcoin bank, or merchant bank, or you could call it a bitcoin finance company," Saylor said, with MicroStrategy creating bitcoin capital market instruments across equity, convertibles, fixed income and preferred shares.

"If we end up with $20 billion of converts, $20 billion of preferred stock, $10 billion of debt and say $50 billion billion of some kind of debt instrument and structures instrument, we'll have $100 billion to $150 billion of bitcoin."

Saylor has built up a hoard of just over 252,000 bitcoin worth $15.7 billion at MicroStrategy by issuing debt to fund bitcoin purchases—a strategy that could mean MicroStrategy gets "margin called" with a demand for extra capital if the bitcoin price should fall below a certain level—but one that Saylor intends to continue.

"I think it's infinitely scalable," Saylor replied. “I don't have any problem seeing how we could raise $100 billion more capital and then $200 billion after that. It's a trillion dollar asset class going to $10 trillion and then going to $100 trillion. The risk is very simple—it’s bitcoin. You either believe bitcoin is something, or you believe it's nothing."

While other companies who have dabbled in bitcoin—such as Elon Musk's Tesla or Wall Street giant BlackRock—have either used gains to fund their businesses or looked to extract fees from clients, Saylor's strategy is more simple.

ForbesTesla Billionaire Elon Musk Issues $35 Trillion U.S. ‘Bankruptcy’ Warning—Predicted To Trigger A Bitcoin Price BoomBy Billy Bambrough

The bitcoin price has surged this year, helping MicroStrategy's share price add a massive 500% over ... [+] the last 12 months.
Forbes Digital Assets

"We just keep buying more bitcoin," Saylor said. "Bitcoin is going to go to millions a coin, you know, and then we create a trillion dollar company," he said, predicting the bitcoin price will hit $13 million by 2045 as it goes from 0.1% of global financial capital to 7%.

MicroStrategy stock has rocketed higher along with the bitcoin price over the last year, outpacing bitcoin as the company's shares attract buyers who want bitcoin exposure but don't want to pay the fees associated with the new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that debuted earlier this year.

The bitcoin price has added 50% since January while MicroStrategy's stock has surged by just over 200%.

"On a relative basis vs. bitcoin, [MicroStrategy] stock is at its highest level since 2019," Wolfe Research managing director Rob Ginsberg wrote in a note to clients seen by CNBC, warning the stock is overbought and recommending "tactically hedging" MicroStrategy gains by buying bitcoin directly.

                            Chase Herro is an online salesman who proudly calls himself a “dirtbag of the internet”, able to sell anything to anyone. Zachary Folkman ran a company called Date Hotter Girls, offering advice under a pseudonym on how to pick up women at bars.

For the past decade or so, the two men have been serial entrepreneurs, leaving behind a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid debt and taxes.

Now, they are former president Donald Trump’s business partners.

Herro and Folkman are the forces behind World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture that Trump and his three sons announced on a livestream last month. The Republican presidential candidate declared his new enterprise would help turn the United States into “the crypto capital of the world”.

                            Chase Herro is an online salesman who proudly calls himself a “dirtbag of the internet”, able to sell anything to anyone. Zachary Folkman ran a company called Date Hotter Girls, offering advice under a pseudonym on how to pick up women at bars.

For the past decade or so, the two men have been serial entrepreneurs, leaving behind a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid debt and taxes.

Now, they are former president Donald Trump’s business partners.

Herro and Folkman are the forces behind World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture that Trump and his three sons announced on a livestream last month. The Republican presidential candidate declared his new enterprise would help turn the United States into “the crypto capital of the world”.

                    Who Is Ryan Salame, Disgraced FTX Exec Who Reported to Prison on LinkedIn
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Ryan Salame, once a high-ranking executive at bankrupt cryptocurrency company FTX, took to LinkedIn this week to share that he is starting a new position — as an inmate in federal prison.Salame was the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, an FTX subsidiary based in the Bahamas.FTX operated a crypto exchange and hedge fund before it collapsed in 2022 over a massive fraud scheme perpetrated by its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. SBF, as he is known, is currently serving his own prison sentence after he was convicting of looting the company he founded.Salame allegedly received $55 million in loans from the company. He was accused of using money from FTX to donate to political campaigns.Salame pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws and operating an illegal money-transmitting business. He was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison and agreed to forfeit $1.5 billion.In an interview with The New York Times before he began his sentence, Salame claimed he had not committed the crimes he admitted to and said he pleaded guilty because of bad legal advice.What Did Ryan Salame's LinkedIn Post Say?"I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new position as Inmate at FCI Cumberland!" Salame wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.The post was in the form of a LinkedIn message meant to broadcast when a job seeker has started a new role. FCI Cumberland is a medium-security federal prison in Maryland.Salame's update has over 13,000 reactions, 1,200 comments, and 900 reposts."Today I learned people still used LinkedIn," Salame wrote on X in response.What was FTX Trading?FTX was a centralized crypto exchange that supported trading for popular cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Investors could bet on the exchange using the FTX token, known as FTT. The token was traded on cryptocurrency markets in a similar way to how stocks are traded.FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after it was revealed that customer funds were being misused. Allegedly, the company had been using billions of dollars of customer deposits to cover losses and fund risky investments by its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research. That revelation caused a run on the exchange and a mass withdrawal of funds that FTX could not fulfill.A federal investigation ensued, and SBF was charged with fraud and money laundering, leading to a high-profile trial that has further eroded trust in the crypto industry. The case has been compared to major financial scandals like Enron, given the scale of the collapse and the regulatory scrutiny that followed.How is FTX Tied to Sam Bankman-Fried?SBF was the co-founder of FTX. He founded the company in 2019 with Gary Wang.He was convicted on seven federal charges in 2022, including wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering and campaign finance law violations. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Who is Michelle Bond?Michelle Bond is Salame's wife. SBF originally connected the two, who met for the first time at a group dinner during a cryptocurrency conference in 2021.Salame and Bond started dating later that year.Bond allegedly received $400,000 in consulting fees from FTX Digital Markets. Bond was running for Congress in Long Island, N.Y. at the time. Prosecutors claimed she spent the money on her campaign. She lost the Republican primary in August of 2022.Bond has also been charged with campaign finance violations by the same U.S attorney's office that prosecuted her husband. She was indicted in August and is awaiting trial.Salame and Bond were married last month in Nevada in a small ceremony.

                    Horst Jicha skips bail in $150 million USI Tech crypto fraud case in New York
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Jicha is scheduled to go on trial in the case March 31, where he faces multiple charges of securities fraud and conspiracy related to a multi-level marketing scheme known as USI Tech.

According to prosecutors, Jicha lied to retail investors when he told them they would make an average of 140% returns on their money in a 140-day period.

Investors were told that there were two ways they could make money: First, they could invest in what were purportedly bitcoin mining and trading operations. They could also earn commissions for referring others to buy USI Tech products, the indictment against Jicha says.

“In reality the platform was just a facade, and when questions arose, Jicha stole millions of his investors’ money and fled the country,” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge James Smith said in January.

As of Friday, Jicha’s whereabouts were unknown. Court records show he had lived in Brazil and Spain before he was arrested in Florida in late 2023.

Jicha was released on bond in January, and had lived in Brooklyn.

Under the conditions of Jicha’s release, he was obligated to remain in New York City or Long Island, and not to leave his home save for court appearances, attorney visits or medical appointments, unless authorized by Pretrial Services.

Jicha, 64, also was required to surrender all passports and travel documents as a condition of his release.

Court records show that Jicha’s $5 million release bond was guaranteed and signed in January by his domestic partner Ewa Jicha, as well as by Jicha’s adult son and his three daughters, and by the boyfriend of one of Jicha’s daughters and by the boyfriend’s brother and father, court records show.

All of those people were residents of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, according to court records.

But under the terms of the bond, they are also personally responsible for the bond’s amount.

After Horst Jicha was released, Ewa Jicha acted as the third-party custodian for him, and was required to report any violations of his release to a U.S. Probation officer.

Jicha was arrested on Dec. 23 in Miami, after entering the United States for the first time in more than five years, to vacation there.

Prosecutors allege that Jicha launched USI Tech in Europe, where, as a co-founder and CEO, he claimed the company would make “cryptocurrency investments easy and accessible to the average retail investor.”

“In reality, it was a multilevel marketing scheme that relied on investors recruiting other investors below them to buy various purported cryptocurrency investments,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in January.

“In 2017, Jicha brought USI Tech to the United States and aggressively marketed it to U.S. retailers on social media and through in-person presentations in which he falsely guaranteed high returns on investments and made false claims about the legality of the platform’s investment offerings,” the office said. There are multiple videos on YouTube showing Jicha hyping the company.

In early 2018, after USI Tech came under regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., “it ceased all U.S. operations overnight, leaving investors with no ability to access their money and resulting in millions of dollars in losses.”

Prosecutors said that much of the missing money in the scam, “valued at approximately $150 million as of the date of his arrest,” was held in the form of ether and bitcoin cryptocurrency. After USI Tech stopped operating, that cryptocurrency was sent to digital deposit addresses controlled by Jicha.

                    Horst Jicha skips bail in $150 million USI Tech crypto fraud case in New York
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Jicha is scheduled to go on trial in the case March 31, where he faces multiple charges of securities fraud and conspiracy related to a multi-level marketing scheme known as USI Tech.

According to prosecutors, Jicha lied to retail investors when he told them they would make an average of 140% returns on their money in a 140-day period.

Investors were told that there were two ways they could make money: First, they could invest in what were purportedly bitcoin mining and trading operations. They could also earn commissions for referring others to buy USI Tech products, the indictment against Jicha says.

"In reality the platform was just a facade, and when questions arose, Jicha stole millions of his investors' money and fled the country," FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge James Smith said in January.

As of Friday, Jicha's whereabouts were unknown. Court records show he had lived in Brazil and Spain before he was arrested in Florida in late 2023.

Jicha was released on bond in January, and had lived in Brooklyn.

Under the conditions of Jicha's release, he was obligated to remain in New York City or Long Island, and not to leave his home save for court appearances, attorney visits or medical appointments, unless authorized by Pretrial Services.

Jicha, 64, also was required to surrender all passports and travel documents as a condition of his release.

Court records show that Jicha's $5 million release bond was guaranteed and signed in January by his domestic partner Ewa Jicha, as well as by Jicha's adult son and his three daughters, and by the boyfriend of one of Jicha's daughters and by the boyfriend's brother and father, court records show.

All of those people were residents of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, according to court records.

But under the terms of the bond, they are also personally responsible for the bond's amount.

After Horst Jicha was released, Ewa Jicha acted as the third-party custodian for him, and was required to report any violations of his release to a U.S. Probation officer.

Jicha was arrested on Dec. 23 in Miami, after entering the United States for the first time in more than five years, to vacation there.

Prosecutors allege that Jicha launched USI Tech in Europe, where, as a co-founder and CEO, he claimed the company would make "cryptocurrency investments easy and accessible to the average retail investor."

"In reality, it was a multilevel marketing scheme that relied on investors recruiting other investors below them to buy various purported cryptocurrency investments," the U.S. Attorney's Office said in January.

"In 2017, Jicha brought USI Tech to the United States and aggressively marketed it to U.S. retailers on social media and through in-person presentations in which he falsely guaranteed high returns on investments and made false claims about the legality of the platform's investment offerings," the office said. There are multiple videos on YouTube showing Jicha hyping the company.

In early 2018, after USI Tech came under regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., "it ceased all U.S. operations overnight, leaving investors with no ability to access their money and resulting in millions of dollars in losses."

Prosecutors said that much of the missing money in the scam, "valued at approximately $150 million as of the date of his arrest," was held in the form of ether and bitcoin cryptocurrency. After USI Tech stopped operating, that cryptocurrency was sent to digital deposit addresses controlled by Jicha.

A former CEO of a cryptocurrency company this week updated his LinkedIn followers to tell them that he would soon be beginning a stint behind bars.

Ryan Salame, former executive of the now bankrupt FTX, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in jail for his role in campaign-finance law violations.

He is due to begin his prison term imminently and astonishingly took to social media yesterday to let his followers know the news.

The former entrepreneur wrote: ‘I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as inmate at FCI Cumberland.’

Salame’s astonishing post has gone viral on social media, garnering over 1,000 reactions and comments on LinkedIn.

Fareesh Vijayarangam commented: ‘Are you open to working remotely?’

Another added: ‘From LinkedIn to LockedIn.’

‘Congratulations! I hear the work uniforms are free too so it’s a win-win,’ commented Timothy C.

Salame also updated his X bio to: ‘7.5 year prison sentence. Former: Free man, US Republican mega-donor, CEO of FTX Digital Markets.’

The 31-year-old pleaded guilty last September to making tens of millions of dollars’ worth of unlawful campaign donations and also agreed to forfeit $1.5 billion.

Prosecutors said Salame, his boss Sam Bankman-Fried and former FTX engineering chief Nishad Singh used FTX customer funds to donate to political candidates supporting crypto-friendly legislation.

Salame reportedly gave more than $24 million to Republican candidates.

                    Former FTX Executive Is Locked-In on LinkedIn and Federal Prison
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame has updated his LinkedIn profile with a new role: a prisoner in a federal correctional institute. “I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Inmate at FCI Cumberland!” He said in a post above an animated image celebrating his new position.

Salame’s job history includes time at a bunch of prestigious crypto businesses. He worked the crypto OTC trading desk at Circle, was the head of OTC at Alameda Research (one of the branches of FTX) and eventually became the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. Now he’s added another job to the list: Inmate, full-time, at FCI Cumberland. His skills? Cleaning and whittling.

The post was a hit on LinkedIn and has, as of this writing, garnered more than 1,000 comments. It was so popular that it broke containment and spread to other social media sites like X where it’s been reposted too many times to count. We love it when someone who’s been convicted of a crime takes it good-naturedly, especially when those crimes are financial in nature.

Salame was part of the executive leadership team of FTX where he worked closely with founder Sam Bankman-Fried and chief engineer Nishad Singh. FTX was a crypto success story, for a while, but it turned out the company was robbing Peter to pay Paul. Now most of its executives are in jail.

In September of last year, Salame pleaded guilty to using FTX’s cash to donate tens of millions of dollars to political campaigns on both sides of the aisle. The goal was to get politicians to pass crypto-friendly legislation. According to the Justice Department, Salame and FTX made more than $300 million in political contributions and lied about where the money came from.

“Ryan Salame agreed to advance the interests of FTX, Alameda Research, and his co-conspirators through an unlawful political influence campaign and through an unlicensed money transmitting business, which helped FTX grow faster and larger by operating outside of the law,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement about Salame’s sentencing. “Salame’s involvement in two serious federal crimes undermined public trust in American elections and the integrity of the financial system. Today’s sentence underscores the substantial consequences for such offenses.”

Salame is 30 and if he’s in the can for his full sentence, he won’t get to update his LinkedIn profile again for more than seven years. In addition to the time behind bars, Salame agreed to forfeit $1.5 billion and pay an additional $6 million forfeiture and more than $5 million in restitution.

Salame is one of the harsher sentences handed down in the wake of the collapse of FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion. His on-again-off-again girlfriend and head of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, was sentenced to two years. Singh and executive Gary Wang are still waiting to hear their fate, which the courts will hand down on October 20 and November 20 respectively.

We’ll have to watch their LinkedIn profiles to see how well they take it.

                    Google Search Now Supports Ethereum Name Service: Details
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Google, which has recently been found to be holding a monopoly on web search, has taken a crypto-friendly decision amidst its ongoing legal battles in the US and the EU. As per a fresh update, Google has fully completed the integratigration of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) into Search. This feature was being tested with select users for a while and has not been made live for Google's global users. Former Google engineer Nick Johnson presented the concept of ENS to the Ethereum Foundation in April 2016, following which, in May 2017, the first batch of ENS names were minted.

This development now makes it easier for people to search for any name based on the ENS domain, signified by ‘.eth'.

ENS can be explained as a decentralised domain name protocol. These Ethereum-based name domains are used by crypto users who wish to simplify complicated Ethereum wallet addresses to make them readable by humans. Otherwise, crypto wallet addresses usually comprise a bunch of random alphabets and digits that are not only difficult to remember in sequence but also maintain that these addresses are only readable by computers.Blockchain.com to Release 82 Million Free Domains to Compete With .ETH Names

Nalin Basu, product manager for Web3 at Google, was the first to confirm the development of X, explaining its utility.

“You all asked for @ensdomains integration, and it's live. You can search for any .eth name and get the balance right in Google Search! Kudos to the Search team for fully rolling this out!” Basu posted on October 9.

Around July 2022, ENS addresses emerged among the most popular liquid assets trading on marketplaces for virtual assets. Usually, easier ENS domains like ‘xyz.eth' are usually more in value than others like ‘asd1as.eth'.

The same year, Google had reportedly first introduced this ENS feature to let Ethereum wallet holders track their Ether balances directly through search results.

Nike's Web3 arm called ‘RTFKT' and Puma are among global brands that have purchased ENS domains in the past.

                    Star Speakers Announced for Crypto Creator Campus in Dubai
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The Crypto Content Creator Campus (CCCC) is set to make waves in the crypto community with its inaugural event scheduled for November 8th to 10th in Dubai. This gathering aims to foster connections among content creators, influencers, and thought leaders in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The event is designed to provide a platform for knowledge sharing and networking among industry enthusiasts, promising to bring together a star-studded lineup of speakers.

Leading the impressive roster is renowned entrepreneur and author Anthony Pompliano, widely regarded as a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency landscape. His insights into the future of finance and digital assets are expected to resonate with attendees. Alongside Pompliano, influential figures such as Laura Shin, a respected journalist and host of the popular podcast “Unchained,” will contribute her extensive knowledge and experience in covering blockchain technology and its implications.

Other notable speakers include Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Zhao’s perspective on market trends and regulatory challenges is anticipated to be a highlight for participants looking to navigate the rapidly evolving crypto environment. Additionally, Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, will share her expertise on smart contracts and decentralized governance, reflecting the growing interest in these areas within the blockchain community.

The CCCC is poised to attract a diverse audience, from content creators seeking to enhance their skills to seasoned professionals aiming to deepen their understanding of the crypto ecosystem. Attendees can expect engaging panel discussions, workshops, and networking opportunities designed to foster collaboration and innovation.

The event will also feature rising stars in the industry, including social media influencers who have successfully leveraged platforms to promote cryptocurrency awareness. Their participation underscores the importance of content creation in driving engagement and educating the public about the potential of digital currencies.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, events like the CCCC play a crucial role in shaping the discourse around blockchain technology and its applications. By bringing together key players in the industry, the campus aims to facilitate knowledge transfer and promote best practices among content creators.

Dubai has emerged as a leading hub for blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, with a growing number of initiatives aimed at fostering innovation in the region. The local government has shown strong support for the industry, positioning the city as a global leader in the adoption of digital currencies and related technologies. The CCCC aligns with Dubai’s vision to become a center for tech-driven enterprises, making it an ideal location for this landmark event.

The campus will also feature various interactive sessions, including workshops focused on content creation, marketing strategies, and community building within the crypto space. Participants will have the opportunity to learn from industry experts and gain practical insights to enhance their content production skills. These sessions are expected to address crucial topics such as effective storytelling, audience engagement, and brand development in the context of cryptocurrency.

In addition to the educational aspects, the event will serve as a marketplace for ideas and collaborations. Networking opportunities are designed to connect content creators with potential partners, sponsors, and mentors, fostering a supportive environment for growth and innovation. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, collaboration among stakeholders is vital for the ecosystem’s overall success.

The CCCC also aims to encourage diversity within the crypto community by actively promoting the inclusion of underrepresented voices in the industry. By spotlighting speakers from various backgrounds, the event seeks to create a more equitable environment where diverse perspectives are valued and heard.

                    Convicted FTX executive announces his ‘new role’ as an inmate at Maryland prison on LinkedIn
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            “I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Inmate at FCI Cumberland,” he posted to Microsoft’s online networking platform on Thursday, complete with the cheerful digital graphic that accompanies job announcements on LinkedIn. 

It’s unusual that someone so openly pokes fun at his own predicament. 

After all, Salame is looking at spending the next seven and a half years in an orange jumpsuit, assuming he serves out his full sentence. 

But perhaps he took inspiration from “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, the Turing CEO convicted of securities fraud. On his LinkedIn profile, Shkreli explained a five-year career break in the New York City metropolitan area simply by writing: “I went to prison.” 

His post has already received more than 7,500 likes, over 800 comments, and been shared close to 600 times. 

‘LinkedIn was invented for this very post’

This time, though, the best part is the replies. Too numerous to count or list here, they are all dripping with the kind of gallows humor rarely found on a site known for its steady stream of boilerplate well wishes.

“LinkedIn was invented for this very post, and I will not be convinced otherwise,” wrote Igor Khrestin, managing director of global policy of the George W. Bush Institute. 

LinkedIn users danced on Salame’s figurative grave because FTX had become one of the most hated companies in America. 

It marked the biggest corporate fraud since Elizabeth Holmes founded fake blood diagnostics firm Theranos.

Run by self-described altruist Sam Bankman-Fried—who once played host to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair—FTX ended up the villain after stealing client funds to cover gambling bets by its sibling crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.

FTX collapse marked the peak of crypto winter

The November 2022 collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long crypto winter, during which various scandals brought disrepute to an entire industry that served a new breed of digitally savvy consumers. 

In 2020 and 2021, millions around the world sought freedom and security from the constant whirr of the central bank printing press by unbanking themselves. 

For these people, cryptocurrencies were a refuge from the traditional financial system and paper money backed only by government fiat.

Bankman-Fried, Salame, and other accomplices, such as Caroline Ellison, betrayed their trust when they conspired to plug holes in their risky speculation with funds FTX was supposed to hold as a custodian. 

Worse, Bankman-Fried repeatedly attempted to deflect criticism and portray his fraud in a more flattering light. 

Salame’s boss was eventually sentenced to 25 years behind bars. 

Not everyone cared for Salame’s tongue-in-cheek humor, however. 

Wisconsin-based public relations professional Jeremy Tunis called the post a case study in “how to generate zero sympathy”.

Instead of the “cringe and tone deaf” announcement, he argued Salame would have been better advised to publish a letter to all the victims of the FTX fraud acknowledging the pain he caused.

                    Best Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets for October 2024
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Benzinga's top picks for the best crypto wallets for this month include ZenGo, Ledger, Trezor and Coinbase.

Choosing a crypto wallet is crucial for securely managing your cryptocurrency because it directly impacts the safety of your digital assets. With numerous options available, it's important to consider factors such as security features, user interface, and compatibility with the specific cryptocurrencies you plan to hold. Most wallets offer support for popular coins like Bitcoin, but some are tailored for Ethereum or even multi-currency support, allowing you to manage a diverse portfolio. The best crypto wallet strikes an optimal balance between security—protecting against hacks and theft—and usability, ensuring that you can easily access and manage your funds without compromising safety.

This guide explores the best Bitcoin and crypto wallets available this month, categorized as either “software” wallets (connected to the internet) or “hardware” wallets (offline storage). We'll compare their strengths and weaknesses to help you choose the cryptocurrency wallet that best suits your needs. 

Quick Look at the Best Crypto Wallets of October 2024:

Best Overall: ZenGoBest Cold Wallet: Ledger Hardware WalletBest for Touchscreen Interface: Trezor Safe 5Best for Beginners: Coinbase WalletBest for Mobile: Trust WalletBest for Ethereum: MetamaskBest for Desktop: ExodusBest for Bitcoin: MyceliumBest for Security: Electrum

Top 9 Best Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets

Let's explore the top Bitcoin and crypto wallets available in the market today.

1. Best Overall: ZenGo

Zengo is one of the most secure wallets on the market today that helps keep you safe without a private key, using MPC tech and the power of Web3. You can access your crypto from anywhere and manage your holdings without worry. 

Perfect for advanced traders and with quality customer care, you can get away from private keys and avoid phishing attacks. Keep in mind that some features may not be available in all locations. 

Why We Picked It: ZenGo climbs to the top spot because it bucks trends and gives you more advanced technology than the competition.

2. Best Cold Wallet: Ledger Hardware Wallet

Ledger is a leading name in hardware wallets, offering secure offline storage for your crypto holdings. Their sleek, flash drive-shaped devices come in two versions: The Ledger Nano S Plus ($79) connects via USB-C, while the Ledger Nano X ($149) has Bluetooth connectivity for on-the-go management through the Ledger Live mobile app. Both support over 5,500 cryptocurrencies and provide access to decentralized finance applications (dApps). However, the Nano S no longer supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ledger goes beyond just secure storage. Ledger Live includes market analysis tools and a crypto tax calculator. They also offer a comprehensive library of educational resources on Ledger Academy, empowering users to navigate the crypto landscape. Compared to competitors like Trezor, which prioritizes security by omitting Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, Ledger offers more convenience with their mobile app connectivity.

Why We Picked It: Ledger's hardware wallets are top-rated for cold, secure, offline crypto storage. They allow access to decentralized finance (DeFi) and easy transfers between hot and cold wallets. The Nano X model even offers a mobile app with Bluetooth connectivity for on-the-go management.

3. Best for Touchscreen Interface: Trezor Safe 5

The Trezor Safe 5 takes hardware crypto storage further with improved security features. Its innovative data backup system and haptic color touch screen provide a secure and user-friendly experience. Traditional backup methods are still available for those who prefer them. The standard model supports over 9,000 cryptocurrencies for coin variety, while a Bitcoin-only version caters to dedicated Bitcoin users. Experts describe the TS5 as “an app on your cellphone” - perfect for everyday use. Trezor even offers a $99 onboarding service with experts to help you set up your wallet and answer any questions. The TS5 is available for pre-order at $169. The TS5 prioritizes user experience with a touch screen and haptic feedback while leveraging a Secure Element chip for enhanced security. The Safe 3 offers a simpler, two-button interface for managing coins and tokens but retains robust security with its Secure Element chip. However, the Safe 3 supports a wider range of cryptocurrencies.

Why We Picked It: Aiming for ultimate security and user-friendliness, the Trezor Safe 5 hardware wallet possesses a colorful touch screen with haptic feedback and improved backup options. It supports over 9,000 cryptocurrencies and even offers a Bitcoin-only version. Like other Trezor wallets, it leverages open-source software for added transparency.

4. Best for Beginners: Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet offers a compelling feature set for crypto enthusiasts. It supports many digital assets, including all ERC-20 tokens built on the Ethereum network, essentially thousands of cryptocurrencies. This makes it a versatile option for those invested in a wide range of coins. The cryptocurrency wallet also prioritizes user experience by allowing users to directly buy, trade, and earn rewards on crypto and NFTs without transferring them to a centralized exchange. This keeps your assets within your control while enabling financial activities. Coinbase Wallet partners with Ledger hardware wallets for enhanced security, facilitating a smooth transition to secure offline storage if desired. However, there are some security considerations. Unlike other wallets, Coinbase Wallet doesn't utilize two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-signature support, which adds extra layers of protection against unauthorized access. Additionally, their software isn't entirely open-source, limiting transparency for some users. Despite these limitations, Coinbase Wallet offers a user-friendly mobile app and browser extension, making managing your crypto on the go convenient. They also provide educational resources and market analysis tools to help you navigate the crypto landscape. Finally, while Coinbase Wallet is free to use, be mindful of network transaction fees associated with cryptocurrency transfers. Coinbase's involvement with unregistered securities through the Wallet app also has ongoing legal uncertainty. While the service continues functioning, considering these legal issues before choosing Coinbase Wallet for your crypto storage needs is worth considering.

Why We Picked It: Ideal for beginners, Coinbase Wallet offers a user-friendly interface on mobile and browsers for easy crypto management. It provides direct access to exchanges and decentralized applications (dApps) for a convenient all-in-one experience.

5. Best for Mobile: Trust Wallet

Trust Wallet, the official mobile app of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, stands out for its vast storage capacity. Despite the Binance connection, Trust Wallet is non-custodial, meaning you hold the private keys to your assets, not the platform. This emphasizes the importance of safeguarding your private keys yourself. Where Trust Wallet shines is its sheer breadth of support. It caters to over 100 blockchains, allowing storage for a staggering 10 million-plus cryptocurrencies and tokens - the most on this list. Furthermore, Trust Wallet caters to NFT enthusiasts with a built-in Web3 browser. This allows direct access to decentralized applications and blockchain games within the app. Buying NFTs is seamless, as users can browse, purchase and store them using the integrated decentralized exchange without leaving the app. Trust Wallet integrates with Binance DEX for those seeking traditional exchange options, facilitating large token purchases with debit or credit cards. This and its high ratings on Apple and Google app stores make Trust Wallet a compelling choice for mobile-focused crypto users who value a diverse and user-friendly experience.

Why We Picked It: We chose Trust Wallet as the best mobile crypto wallet due to its user-friendly interface, vast support for over 10 million digital assets, and built-in features for interacting with dApps and NFTs. This makes it a versatile option for those who want to explore the full potential of the crypto world from their mobile phone.

6. Best for Ethereum: Metamask

With over 30 million users, MetaMask is a leading Ethereum wallet known for its user-friendly design. Beginners can easily store, send, and manage Ethereum-compatible cryptocurrencies and interact with decentralized applications. MetaMask offers versatility beyond Ethereum. Users can add various blockchain networks to the app, allowing access to popular options like Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. This expanded functionality makes it a valuable tool for exploring the broader crypto landscape. Furthermore, MetaMask integrates with popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, facilitating NFT discovery, trading, and storage. Security is a priority for MetaMask. It is built on open-source code and allows developers and security experts to scrutinize it independently. Additionally, user account information is encrypted and remains entirely on your device, never touching MetaMask servers. This ensures you maintain complete control over your private keys. MetaMask's ability to seamlessly switch between different Web3 solutions makes it a convenient all-in-one platform for managing crypto assets and exploring decentralized applications.

Why We Picked It: We crown MetaMask as the best Ethereum wallet for beginners. Its user-friendly interface, available as a browser extension or mobile app, grants easy access to thousands of Ethereum tokens and decentralized applications within the Ethereum network. Plus, it connects to popular NFT marketplaces for a well-rounded crypto experience.

7. Best for Desktop: Exodus

Exodus started as a desktop-only cryptocurrency wallet but has expanded to iOS & Android and even integrates with Trezor hardware wallets. Despite the mobile options, their core offering remains the feature-rich desktop app, updated every two weeks across Windows, Linux, and Mac. A major draw of Exodus is its extensive support for over 335 cryptocurrencies and NFTs, exceeding many other hot wallets. This includes established altcoins like Ether and Litecoin and popular meme coins like Dogecoin. Beyond its visually appealing interface, Exodus offers a growing suite of apps, expanding its functionality. Explore live market charts, earn interest through crypto staking, and even buy crypto directly within the wallet using fiat deposits. Exodus allows customization of fees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 transactions for added control. They also leverage a “light client” system, verifying transactions without downloading entire blockchains, which speeds up operations. However, remember that Exodus is primarily a hot wallet, meaning your assets are connected to the internet and potentially more vulnerable. For maximum security, consider pairing it with their Trezor hardware wallet integration.

Why We Picked It: We chose Exodus as the best desktop crypto wallet due to its speedy transactions, beginner-friendly interface, and diverse functionalities. It boasts support for over 330 crypto assets, integrates with Trezor hardware wallets for enhanced security, and even allows users to conveniently purchase Bitcoin with Apple Pay. Plus, 24/7 customer service offers peace of mind.

8. Best for Bitcoin: Mycelium

Mycelium has a long history, being one of the first and most respected Bitcoin wallets available. Currently a mobile-only app (Android and iPhone), it prioritizes a simple and user-friendly interface. However, compared to other wallets, Mycelium offers limited cryptocurrency support. It primarily focuses on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens (like Tether USD and USD Coin), excluding the vast array of newer cryptocurrencies. Transactions are facilitated directly within the app; you can purchase Bitcoin using traditional currency. Security is a focus, as Mycelium is a non-custodial wallet, meaning you control your private keys. Uniquely, it's also the only open-source hot wallet on this list. While this transparency enhances security, it comes with limited technical support options. Troubleshooting primarily relies on the email address listed on the website.

Why We Picked It: Mycelium shines for Bitcoin and Ethereum users who prioritize security. This non-custodial wallet provides straightforward transaction capabilities and offers full control over your private keys, making it ideal for users seeking simplicity and security in managing their Bitcoin investments. 

9. Best for Security: Electrum

Electrum is a veteran in the cryptocurrency world, renowned for its security features and robust functionality. It's a Bitcoin-only wallet that focuses on providing a lightweight yet secure platform for managing BTC. Electrum offers advanced security features such as two-factor authentication (2FA), transaction verification, and multi-signature wallet support. Users can customize transaction fees based on their desired processing speed - pay more for faster confirmation. Its efficiency is another advantage. Electrum utilizes a “light client” system, minimizing download size and setup time compared to traditional wallets. It achieves this by employing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), which downloads only essential blockchain data to speed up transactions without sacrificing security. Electrum's code is publicly available for review as an open-source wallet, fostering trust among users. It also supports standard and Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) accounts for greater flexibility and integrates with popular hardware wallets like KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor for enhanced offline storage.

Why We Picked It: We crown Electrum as the most secure hot wallet due to its robust features like 2FA and multi-signature support. Plus, it offers high customizability, letting you adjust transaction fees for faster confirmations. Electrum's unique server setup also ensures your cryptocurrency wallet rarely experiences downtime.

What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to securely store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and track your balances. It also enables users to connect to decentralized applications (dApps) like exchanges and games. Notably, wallets don't store the actual coins but provide access through public and private keys, which must be kept secure to protect your funds.

How Do Crypto Wallets Work?

A cryptocurrency wallet works like a tool with two main jobs: keeping your crypto safe and helping you move it around. It acts like a digital middleman between you and the blockchain network, a massive public record of all cryptocurrency transactions.

Here's how it works: Let's say you want to send some Bitcoin to a friend. First, you'd open your cryptocurrency wallet app and tell it how much Bitcoin you want to send and your friend's wallet address. The wallet creates a digital message with these details, like a proposal for the transaction. Once you confirm you're happy with everything, the wallet steps in with its secret weapon: your private key. Think of this like a unique signature that proves you own the Bitcoin you're trying to send. The wallet uses this key to “sign” the transaction message, making it official. Finally, the signed message gets sent to the blockchain network over the internet. There, it joins a queue of other transactions waiting to be verified and added to the permanent record. 

Types of Crypto Wallets

Here are the two major types of cryptocurrency wallets:

Software Wallets: Software wallets, such as apps on your mobile phone or computer, enable you to store, send, and manage your cryptocurrency. They act as a bridge between the blockchain and your mobile device. These wallets store your private keys, like passwords to access your crypto. There are two main types: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial wallets (like exchange wallets) hold your keys for you, while non-custodial wallets give you complete control. While convenient and user-friendly, software wallets are considered "hot storage" because your keys are online and vulnerable to hacking. This makes them less secure than hardware wallets, which store keys offline.

Hardware Wallets: Hardware wallets offer the most secure storage for your cryptocurrency's private keys. Unlike a physical wallet, it doesn't hold your actual coins, but rather safeguards the keys needed to access them on the blockchain (offline storage). Many hardware wallets work with multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing you to manage various coins on a single device. Recovery phrases or PIN codes ensure easy data backup. Some even enable direct trading from the wallet, eliminating exchange transfers and associated fees. This offline, self-custody approach is the safest way to store and trade crypto.

Custodial wallets are like traditional banks - a third party (like Coinbase) holds your private keys (like your bank card PIN) and manages your funds. This is convenient, but they control your money. Choose a reliable, regulated custodian for better security and insurance options. On the other hand, non-custodial wallets are like safety deposit boxes. You hold the key (private key) and have complete control over your crypto. This is ideal for experienced users who value self-reliance, but losing your key means losing your crypto forever. Remember, “not your keys, not your coins.” While noncustodial wallets are less vulnerable to data breaches, some require internet access. For the most security, consider offline hardware wallets.

What Is a Cold Wallet?

Cold crypto wallets are like high-security fortresses for your crypto. They're super tough to crack because:

You need the physical device itself, not just a password.Even when connected to a computer, the super secret keys never leave the wallet itself.Transactions are signed securely within the device before being broadcast.

What Is a Hot Wallet?

Hot wallets are like digital wallets for crypto on your phone or computer. They're convenient for everyday transactions and buying new coins, but not the most secure. Imagine a pickpocket - if a hacker gets online access, your crypto is at risk. 

How to Choose a Cryptocurrency Wallet

When choosing a cryptocurrency wallet, there are several important factors to consider:

Security: Look for a wallet with robust security features like multifactor authentication, encryption, and offline storage options to protect your private keys and prevent unauthorized access.Ease of use: Choose a wallet with a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, especially if you are new to cryptocurrency. The wallet should have clear instructions and helpful resources.Compatibility: Ensure the wallet is compatible with the cryptocurrencies you want to store. Some wallets only support specific coins or tokens.Backup and recovery: Ensure the cryptocurrency wallet offers reliable backup and recovery options if you lose access to your mobile device or account. Look for wallets that allow you to create and store recovery phrases securely.Transparency: Research the wallet provider's reputation, transparency and track record. Look for wallets that have been audited by third-party security firms and have a history of reliable service.Control: Consider how much control you want over your private keys. Some wallets, like hardware wallets, give you complete control, while others, like exchange wallets, hold your keys.Fees: Be aware of any fees associated with using the wallet, such as transaction or withdrawal fees. Compare costs across different wallets to find the most cost-effective option.Mobility: Decide whether you need a mobile, desktop, or hardware wallet based on your needs. Mobile wallets offer convenience, while hardware wallets provide the highest level of security for long-term storage.

How to Set Up a Crypto Wallet

Ready to jump into the world of cryptocurrency? The first step is creating a cryptocurrency wallet to store and manage your digital assets. Here's how to get started:

Pick your wallet provider: This is like choosing a bank. Research different wallet apps and pick one with a good reputation and security features. Popular options include Exodus, Electrum, and Trust Wallet.Download the app: Once you've chosen your wallet, download the app to your mobile phone or desktop computer. To avoid scams, ensure you get it from the official app store or the wallet provider's website.Create your account: Set up your account with your name, email, and a strong password. For additional security, some wallets might also ask for verification, like a selfie and ID.Fund your wallet: Now that your wallet is set up, it's time to add some crypto! You can transfer funds from your bank account, exchange other cryptocurrencies, or receive them from someone else. Most wallets accept cryptocurrencies and provide a unique address to send your crypto. Some wallets even offer QR codes for easy transfers.

                    Crypto-Friendly Dubai Issues Cease-and-Desist Orders Against Seven Entities
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The Emirate of Dubai, which in recent times has taken multiple measures to establish and promote itself as a hotspot of Web3 activities, is now identifying illegal crypto entities operating within its region. In the latest development, the Web3 governing body of Dubai has initiated an action against seven companies dealing with virtual assets. The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was formed in 2022 to ensure that all companies are linked to virtual digital assets (VDAs).

VARA released a statement on the situation this week, claiming that this move is aimed at strengthening its enforcement programme against law evaders. The authority, however, has not disclosed the names of the entities in question.

The reason why these entities have been sent cease-and-desist orders, as per VARA, is for operating their businesses without acquiring the required approvals.VanEck to Infuse Funding for Early Stage Crypto, AI Businesses

“VARA will not tolerate any attempts to operate without appropriate licences, nor will we allow unauthorised marketing of virtual asset activities. Our priority is to ensure that Dubai's virtual assets ecosystem remains secure for consumers and investors while being a progressive environment for compliant entities,” its statement said.

At present,” probe into these firms is underway in Dubai. If found guilty, these firms can face fines ranging between AED 50,000 (roughly Rs. 42 lakh) and AED 100,000 (roughly Rs. 84.09 lakh), alongside other decided punishments.

In the backdrop of this situation, VARA has issued a reminder to the market players saying that the infamously volatile virtual asset industry is strictly regulated in the region. Moreover, entities looking to continue offering their services in Dubai have been reminded that they are obligated to comply with all requirements as per the VARA rules.UNODC Suggests Penalties for Unlicensed Crypto Firms in Southeast Asia

“Market enforcement actions send a reinforcing message: VARA will not tolerate any attempts to operate without appropriate licences, nor will we allow unauthorised marketing of virtual asset activities. Our marketing regulations further emphasise Dubai's commitment to ensuring transparency and always protecting stakeholder interests,” its statement added.

The development comes after Dubai gave operational approvals to crypto firms, including Crypto.com, OKX, and Binance, among others.

Since coming into existence, the VARA has taken several decisions that elevates Dubai's position in the Web3 sector. While the majority of nations are still working to finalise their respective crypto laws – Dubai released VARA-framed comprehensive crypto laws around two years ago.

Back in April this year, VARA regulators said small crypto players will get special benefits in Dubai that include cost-effective operational and compliance process for smaller players.

In March 2024, Dubai [prepared] reportedly four rulebooks for crypto service providers, detailing crypto regulations. The Emirate has imposed an application charge of $27,000 (roughly Rs. 22 lakh) for crypto firms seeking operational permissions.

                    Forcing The Hand Of World's Largest $XRP Holder – Ripple Files Cross-Appeal In SEC Case
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Less than a week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a notice to appeal the court's 2023 ruling over the XRP token's status as a non-security, Ripple Labs, which is closely associated with the cryptocurrency and is the token's largest holder, filed a notice to cross-appeal.The notice was filed Thursday, with Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty declaring that he expects the Wall Street regulator to lose the legal fight. "We look forward to the federal court of appeals finally putting a stake in the heart of [Gary] Gensler's misguided attack on our industry," he said in a statement on X.What Was the Ruling?The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 over its alleged illegal security offering in the XRP token. In mid-2023, District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that while the institutional sales of XRP violated federal securities law, the token's sales in exchanges through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts.The ruling marked a partial yet significant victory for Ripple, especially since the SEC has repeatedly based its lawsuits against crypto firms on "whether a digital asset has the characteristics of one particular type of security – an 'investment contract.'"Last week, the SEC filed a notice to appeal the said ruling, drawing criticism from the crypto community and crypto lawyers who believe the financial regulator is betting on a losing fight.On the other hand, Ripple has vowed to continue fighting the SEC and defending its stance that XRP is not a security and thus should not be regulated by the SEC.Crypto Community Cheers Ripple OnCrypto users and experts alike didn't fail to express support for Ripple in its continuing battle against the SEC, with some urging politicians who have said they support the industry to speak up.Crypto lawyer James Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, said "pro-innovation politicians" should come out in support of Ripple by filing amicus briefs, legal documents filed by parties not involved in a current case that provide relevant expertise and information.On the Chain podcast founder Chip said the "SEC just sealed their own fate" in the Ripple case after appealing. He said that the fintech and digital asset custody firm would have just walked away if the regulator just let the ruling be.One user said the SEC's appeal was just an attempt to "save face" but it will only "erode" what's left of the public's trust in Wall Street's top regulator.Meanwhile, XRP prices have been climbing in the last 24 hours. The token is up by 2.5% following news of Ripple's cross-appeal notice. The crypto token has also increased by 2.7% in the past week.

                    HashKey Capital H1 Crypto Analysis: AI Integration, TON's Potential To Challenge WeChat
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The cryptocurrency industry has seen immense growth in the past decade, breaking barriers for unbanked individuals, and creating opportunities for the new digital economy.In its first half 2024 analysis of the crypto industry, leading crypto investment firm and platform HashKey Capital laid bare the top trends that showed significant promise for the future of finance.Highlights of the HashKey H1 Crypto Sector Analysis:
A surge in Ethereum-based projects – HashKey analysts saw an increasing number of zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) projects shifting to a zkVM (zero-knowledge Virtual Machine) with the PSE team under Ethereum Foundation in the frontline. Furthermore, the launch of EigenLayer's restaking feature triggered an emergence of new DeFi products, with TVL peaking at $20 billion.
Messaging mainstream – The TON (The Open Network) blockchain saw a whopping 200% growth in the first half of the year, leveraging popular messaging app Telegram's 900 million monthly active users. The H1 growth is also "attributed to the slew of mini apps developing on TON that are vying for the huge user base on Telegram," the report noted. HashKey sees a lot of potential for TON to "mirror the success of WeChat" in terms of large-scale monetization.
AI x Crypto – HashKey also observed increased demand for decentralized AI infrastructure in the first six months of 2024. Projects are emerging across data, computing, and verification networks. "These developments underscore the growing focus on data-driven AI ecosystems and the importance of both privacy and decentralized infrastructures in the future of AI applications," the report said.
Tokenization IRL – Tokenization of real world assets (RWAs) continue to gain traction, as exemplified by BlackRock's BUIDL fund surpassing $500 million in assets under management (AUM). While there is an apparent increase in appetite among institutional investors to leverage blockchain to tokenize financial products, "regulatory risks remain at the top of mind for most executives and hence exposure to public blockchain remains limited," the report noted.
Gaming is Maturing – Outside the expanding mini games ecosystem on TON, several other blockchain gaming networks have also been on the rise. For instance, the Ronin network led Tier 1 gaming, backed by strong gaming communities such as Pixels.
HashKey expects many of the top trends in the first quarter to continue building momentum in the second half of the year. In an exclusive with International Business Times, Jeffrey Hu, Head of Research at HashKey Capital, shared his thoughts on the trends that will likely retain momentum throughout the rest of 2024.AI x Crypto to Sizzle Hot Through Year-End 2024Hu believes the convergence of crypto and AI will likely "stay red hot" in the second half of the year. Already in the third quarter, HashKey is seeing AI and crypto projects accounting for many new projects in the space.AI has cemented its status on top as it blossomed into various specialized areas such as data decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized inference, decentralized model training and fine-tuning, and more."This popularity stems partly from all the buzz and innovation happening in AI broadly. But it's also because blockchain can enhance AI with more privacy, verifiability, and flexible compute power. So in a nutshell, AI looks poised to remain a major theme through year-end and beyond," Hu said.TON's Potential to Go by the WeChat PlaybookTelegram is popular worldwide and many crypto communities use the platform due to blockchain integration and its encrypted offering. Integration with TON has only driven the blockchain's popularity. However, growth was specifically apparent in Asia in H1.Chinese instant messaging app WeChat is one of the top platforms in Asia due to its various offerings such as WeChat Pay, e-commerce, and mini games. Can TON flip the script and become a top messaging platform in Asia?"There's huge potential for TON to follow WeChat's playbook and achieve massive monetization through mini apps. Gaming is the top mini app category, followed by e-commerce and everyday services. So there's still tons of room to run there," Hu said.He also revealed that there has been a gradual shift in the industry from hype-driven narratives "to caring more about real business metrics." Hu expects that factors such as user numbers, revenue, and other related metrics "will carry more weight than pure narratives" moving forward.At this point, crypto exchanges and other institutions are eager to partner with projects boasting many active users. "This should motivate projects to double down on building real businesses and user bases, creating a positive feedback loop," he said.Crypto in 10 YearsWhile Hu believes it is "tricky" to make projections for the next decade, he is "confident" that the broader crypto industry will see broader institutional "and even national adoption."He pointed to the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and Hong Kong as just the catalyst for adoption beyond enthusiasts and advocates.He is looking forward to how El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy will play out in the next 10 years, as well as that of Argentina, whose Vice President recently told Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele that she's interested in El Salvador's BTC bonds."Based on blockchain's fundamental nature, I think we'll see renewed focus on some core use cases. Payments are already trending this year. We'll likely see more development around asset custody, cross-border settlement and related applications," he projected.Crypto has gone a long way since Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the world's first decentralized digital currency. Based on HashKey's analysis of the state of crypto in H1, it is safe to say that the burgeoning sector is poised for a good run throughout the rest of the year.
