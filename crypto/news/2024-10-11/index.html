                    Airdrops: Realities of latest crypto craze
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            COMFORT AKINRETI writes about the recent trend in cryptocurrency space whereby thousands of Nigerians sought to earn money from airdrops by tapping their phones.

TAP, tap!” You may have heard this coinage recently. It is used to describe a trending practice you may have witnessed whereby people are constantly tapping the screen of their smartphones as part of the things they have to do to increase the money they would like get from a cryptocurrency airdrop.

Nigerians, mostly the younger ones have been doing “tap, tap” more formally known as tap-to-earn as a strategy to “mine” cryptocurrency.

Many Nigerians were attracted to this practice and became aware of cryptocurrency airdrop after a particular airdrop from a cryptocurrency called Notcoin took place. This airdrop appeared to be a success and a good sum of money came to holders of this coin within its community, thus making cryptocurrency airdrop more popular among Nigerians.

However, what a vast majority of cryptocurrency enthusiasts were introduced to has appeared to be a pipe dream because they were simply eager to join the bandwagon of those “earning in dollars,” and did not properly understand what the cryptocurrency world entails.

What is a cryptocurrency airdrop?

Investopedia describes cryptocurrency airdrop “a marketing strategy that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.” Other promotional services required to partake in the airdrop include responding to social media posts, following accounts, and as stated earlier, tapping to earn. Airdrops are frequently used by cryptocurrency businesses to raise awareness about a new token and increase the number of individuals who trade it after it is listed on an exchange.

Cryptocurrency airdrops have quickly become a popular tool for firms to promote new tokens, with participants earning digital assets for completing simple activities such as following social media accounts or sharing posts. This approach has gained traction in regions such as Nigeria a where interest in cryptocurrencies is growing. Airdrops provide a convenient way for many people to learn about and participate in the blockchain ecosystem. However, airdrops are not without obstacles. As more people join these initiatives, token value can sometimes be diluted owing to “airdrop farming,” which occurs when too many participants diminish the value of the prizes. Some participants have been frustrated after putting in a lot of time and effort for little results.

Learning by experience

Notcoin (NOT), like Hamster Kombat and a host of others, is a game embedded in Telegram that attracted millions of players. This play-to-earn game functions as a mini-app within the Telegram messaging platform, where users can “mine” or earn the NOT token.

By March 2024, the game had amassed 35 million total players, with a peak of six million daily active users, making it one of the most popular crypto games.

On May 16, 2024, the NOT token was officially launched. Notcoin price surged 600 percent when top exchanges, Binance and OKX, listed the NOT token.

Following Notcoin, most people jumped into the current tap-to-earn projects, such as Hamster Kombat, Tapswap, Memefi, Dogs, Tomarket, and others, with great expectations. What has been the experience of most Nigerians so far is that their high expectations were not met.

Social media users expressed their grievances about some of the disappointments they have encountered in airdrops. Here are some from X, formerly known as Twitter:

@Sam_Art6675, wrote: “walai @hamster kombat, you will crumble. Since June, I’ve been tapping and tapping, now you pay me like a cleaner instead of CEO.”

@adaora_crypto posted: “if you must use your money to farm any tap to earn… Make sure you have done your due diligence and it will be worth it like citizen. A lot of projects will onboard new users and insists they should pay some $Ton at some point but verify verily I say unto you… Most of those project will end up farming the community and giving them nothing….”

@hommiesDrey posted: “So I use 2 TON valued at $14 collect CATS airdrop valued at $15…’’

@damxton wrote: “When farming airdrops, never have high expectations. Because you’ll be disappointed when it doesn’t cook. Even if you are sticking with a few that you think will cook, there is a 50 chance they won’t cook!”

@echoboomph posted: “There are a lot of scammers who will pose as legit accounts and will do scam airdrop giveaways. So, be warned. You might get caught in their phishing scams.”

Going for what is legitimate

Also, Irene Knight from Banjul in Gambia while discussing about her involvement in different airdrops and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), said that she knows how legitimate an airdrop is by going through the project’s social media channels to check their roadmaps. A roadmap provides an organised sequential plan for achieving the targets, objectives, aims, and expected results of a cryptocurrency project.

While speaking with Nigerian Tribune, Oguntade Adedoyin from Magboro, Ogun State said he has had very satisfying experiences in his two years of participating in airdrops.

He said that he believes that airdrops impact the crypto market positively. He said, “I sell 50 percent of my tokens and hold 50 percent to trade in case of bull run.”

People with lesser years of experience like 30-year-old Micheal James from Lagos, who started participating in airdrops less than a year ago, asserted that from his knowledge about cryptocurrency airdrops, it just brings more audience to the cryptocurrency space.

Stephen Adewole from Ile-Ife in Osun State, shared his experience from the Hamster Kombat airdrop describing it as a loss. He said, “When I received my Hamster Kombat token, I was not satisfied because taking part in the airdrops cost me my time and efforts. But with my years of experience in this, I actually predicted it would happen because the airdrop has been over farmed. Even if the project had good plans for the community, the number of the participants was just too much.”

Olaito Yusuff, lives in Apomu, Osun State. He shared what he described as his “fairly satisfactory experience” with the

He stated that he saw cryptocurrency airdrops as a gamble or a game of luck. According to him, he dabbled into airdrops farming for financial gains and he has participated in about 200 airdrops.

He said that with his over two years’ experience with airdrops, he is personally convinced that airdropped tokens do not have long-term value potential.

Speaking about how to confirm the legitimacy of an airdrop, he said, “I focus more on the activities of the startup developers both internally and externally and also the amount of liquidity they are bringing into the project. Cryptocurrency exchanges are vulnerable to devastating hacks, while wallet weaknesses expose users to theft, and phishing attacks deceive victims into revealing sensitive information. Users can also encounter scams like fake token scams.”

Amana Alkali, a corporate, real estate and fintech law expert stated that: “A crypto airdrop is like a digital version of a surprise giveaway. Unfortunately, the popularity of airdrops has attracted scammers. One common scam involves fake airdrop campaigns that aim to trick users into providing personal information or private keys. It’s crucial to verify the legitimacy of airdrop campaigns and exercise caution.”

                            Former FTX executive Ryan Salame prepared to start his 7 ½ year prison sentence with one final Very Online post.Salame, 31, who was a member of Sam Bankman-Fried's inner circle, took to LinkedIn with a life update two days before he was set to report to a federal correctional institution in Cumberland, Maryland."I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new position as Inmate at FCI Cumberland," Salame posted on Wednesday.In May, a federal judge sentenced Salame to 7 ½ years in prison on fraud and campaign finance charges related to the collapse of Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange in 2022.Prosecutors accused Salame of conspiring with Bankman-Fried to defraud FTX investors and customers, as well as making hundreds of illegal political campaign donations.Salame was one of four top FTX executives who pleaded guilty after the company went bankrupt. Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research; Gary Wang, former FTX technology chief; and Nishad Singh, former FTX engineering chief, also agreed to cooperate with federal investigators.Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March.Salame got his start at Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research before becoming co-CEO of FTX's Bahamian affiliate in 2021.In the months leading up to the start of his prison sentence, Salame frequently posted through the pain, taking to the internet to share hundreds of posts on X.Among Salame's pre-prison musings, he shared support for former President Donald Trump after the Republican candidate spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville. He's also complained about the legal system being unfair.Salame's prison start date was delayed several times after a dog bit him.Last month, he tried to withdraw his guilty plea, saying prosecutors broke a promise to him when they indicted Michelle Bond, a cryptocurrency advocate and Salame's romantic partner, earlier this year. Prosecutors have strongly denied the allegation.Salame later tried to withdraw his withdrawal but instead got a 30-minute courtroom grilling from US District Judge Lewis Kaplan.

Top 5 Best Crypto Exchanges in the UK

Here is the list of the top crypto exchanges in the United Kingdom:

1. Best for Beginners: Coinbase

Launched in 2012, Coinbase is a popular cryptocurrency exchange serving over 100 million users. It's particularly well-suited for beginners due to its user-friendly interface and educational resources. However, it's important to be aware of Coinbase'sfees, which can be higher than other options. For instance, buying crypto with a debit card on Coinbase incurs a 3.99% fee, significantly steeper than the 0.5% charged by some competitors. A separate 1% commission applies on crypto trading. Despite the higher crypto exchange fees, Coinbase prioritizes security. Account logins require two-factor authentication, and additional checks are implemented for unrecognized devices. They also store 98% of client crypto assets in secure offline storage (cold storage). Finally, Coinbase offers a convenient mobile app (iOS and Android) that functions as an exchange and a crypto wallet.

Coinbase's regulatory compliance in the UK involves adhering to stringent financial regulations set forth by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other relevant authorities. This compliance includes implementing robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures, ensuring that all customers are thoroughly verified before they can buy cryptocurrencies.

Why We Picked It: Coinbase offers a vast selection of over 200 cryptocurrencies for trading. Despite the fees, Coinbase caters well to beginners with its user-friendly interface and secure platform. They even offer a built-in cryptocurrency wallet to store your coins.

2. Best for Advanced Traders: Kraken

Another top UK crypto exchange is Kraken, which has over ten million users globally. Kraken shines with its low trading fees, starting at just 0.16% per transaction. These fees decrease as your trading volume increases. Kraken offers instant buying options with a slightly higher fee of 1.5% for most crypto and 0.9% for stablecoins. Security-conscious investors will appreciate Kraken's spotless record: they've never had a major security breach. Their CSO50 award for outstanding security protocols also speaks volumes about their commitment to protecting your digital assets. Kraken offers a wide range of options for both beginners and experienced traders. Newbies can explore over 200 cryptocurrencies, while seasoned investors can leverage margin trading and futures options to potentially maximize their returns. Plus, Kraken Pro unlocks advanced charting tools for in-depth technical analysis. They store 95% of user funds in secure cold storage, offering peace of mind for your crypto holdings. 

Why We Picked It: Kraken offers trading in over 200 cryptocurrencies. There's a fee for buying Bitcoin with a debit card, but trading fees start much lower at 0.16% per transaction (or 1.5% for instant purchases). Like Coinbase, Kraken provides a secure cryptocurrency wallet and stores 95% of user assets in cold storage while offering advanced trading options.

3. Best for Copy Trading: eToro

Looking for a user-friendly crypto trading platform with social features in the United Kingdom? eToro might be a good fit. Deposits made with a UK debit card are processed instantly, while transfers from a bank account can take a day or two. They charge a deposit fee of 0.5% on GBP payments, which is generally lower than other crypto exchanges. When buying or selling any of their 70+ cryptocurrencies, a flat fee of 1% applies. Popular available crypto trading options include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum and Cardano. Convenience is a plus with eToro's mobile app (iOS and Android), which allows you to trade and store your crypto on the go. For a more hands-off approach, explore their prebuilt Crypto Smart Portfolios. These thematic portfolios, like the Coinshares France SAS option, offer exposure to various cryptocurrencies with varying weights managed by eToro. Another social feature is copy trading, where you can mimic the trades of experienced investors. With thousands of verified traders to choose from and a $10 minimum investment, it's a low barrier to entry. Keep in mind that eToro primarily focuses on cryptocurrencies, but it also offers thousands of UK and international stocks and ETFs. You can even speculate on contracts-for-difference (CFDs) across various asset classes.

Why We Picked It: eToro offers over 70 cryptocurrencies for trading. There is a flat fee of 0.5% on deposits and a 1% fee on buying Bitcoin on eToro (plus spread). While they provide a mobile wallet, their strength lies in variety. eToro boasts a user-friendly platform with social trading features and offers a wide range of assets beyond just crypto.

4. Best for Diversification: PrimeXBT

PrimeXBT caters to those who value low barriers to entry. Unlike some cryptocurrency exchanges, they don't have a minimum deposit, allowing you to try out the platform with any amount before committing more. Deposits can be made with various cryptocurrencies and fiat money through third-party services like AdvCash and Perfect Money. PrimeXBT shines with its competitive fees. Crypto trading fees start at 0.01%, with even lower maker/taker fees of 0.01% and 0.02% for crypto futures contracts. They also offer copy trading, enabling you to mimic the trades of experienced investors, which can be helpful for beginners. Speaking of beginners, PrimeXBT Academy offers educational resources to help you navigate the crypto trading platform, understand crypto basics, and even delve into advanced topics like blockchain and NFTs. Beyond crypto, PrimeXBT allows you to diversify your portfolio with traditional assets like currencies, stock indexes, and commodities such as gold, oil, and gas. This makes it a well-rounded platform for those seeking a wider range of investment options. However, keep in mind the limited fiat deposit options through third-party services. 

Why We Picked It: PrimeXBT offers over 40 cryptocurrencies for trading but has no built-in crypto wallet. The deposit fee and how much you pay for Bitcoin depend on the third-party service you use. This platform stands out for its low trading fees and the ability to copy experienced traders but keep in mind the limited ways to deposit fiat currency.

5. Best for Spot Trading: MEXC

MEXC stands out for its competitive fee structure. Notably, they offer 0% spot trading fees, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. For those interested in futures trading, taker fees start at as low as 0.02% per transaction, with limited orders even enjoying a 0% fee. But MEXC isn't just about low fees. They offer a vast selection of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies to trade, including popular options like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. Seasoned traders can leverage their holdings for potentially amplified returns with up to 10x leverage. Security is a priority at MEXC. They store over half a billion dollars worth of user cryptocurrency in secure cold storage and require two-factor authentication (2FA) and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for added protection. Beyond trading, MEXC Launchpad allows you to discover and invest in newly launched crypto projects. You can also generate passive income by staking popular coins like Bitcoin and Polkadot, potentially earning up to 10% annual returns. MEXC offers 24/7 customer support and advanced trading tools to help you make informed decisions. The platform is accessible from your desktop or through their mobile app (iOS and Android). 

Why We Picked It: MEXC is a great cryptocurrency exchange platform for investors focused on spot trading, as they uniquely charge 0% fees for those transactions. There's a wide selection of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies to trade, and you can even earn passive income by staking certain tokens with yields up to 10%. However, keep in mind there's a 2% fee for buying Bitcoin with a debit card.

How to Choose the Best Crypto Exchange in the UK

Here are the key factors to consider when choosing a cryptocurrency exchange in the United Kingdom:

Regulation is the first and foremost thing every trader must consider if they are starting trading. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the reputed regulator for the UK market, so it is recommended that traders prioritize those regulated by FCA.

Available Crypto Range

A wide range of tradable assets makes it convenient for any trader to diversify their portfolio. There are hundreds of trading strategies, but every crypto may not support each trading strategy. So, you can choose the cryptocurrency that suits your trading style. Above all, you must go with the cryptocurrency exchange offering many coin options, including Bitcoin and altcoins like Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, BNB and Bitcoin Cash.

Crypto Trading Fees

When choosing the best crypto trading platform in the United Kingdom, it is essential to evaluate fees, including deposit and commission charges. For instance, eToro charges a 0.5% fee for instant deposits with a debit card, while Coinbase can charge up to 3.99%. Trading commissions vary widely; MEXC commission starts at 0% for spot trading. Understanding these fees is crucial for making informed decisions and minimizing costs.

Type of Wallet Offered

After buying crypto from an exchange, the tokens are initially stored by the exchange itself, allowing investors to see their balances by logging into their accounts. However, this means the exchange holds the private key to the cryptocurrency wallet, which might not be ideal for all investors. Many UK crypto exchanges, like eToro, offer their own crypto wallet apps, which provide more flexibility for storing and transferring crypto.

Payment Methods

When trying to buy crypto for the first time, investors must choose a cryptocurrency exchange that accepts regular money (fiat payments). Users can deposit funds using a UK debit/credit card or digital wallet, or by transferring money from their bank account. It's important to check the payment fees for the chosen deposit method. Additionally, investors should look at the minimum deposit requirement for the exchange.

Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges Legal in the UK?

While buying and selling cryptocurrencies through exchanges is legal in the United Kingdom, it's important to understand the regulatory landscape. Crypto assets are unregulated, so crypto exchanges operating in the United Kingdom don't necessarily need authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority. However, choosing an FCA-registered exchange offers peace of mind. They operate under the FCA's guidelines, ensuring a legitimate platform. Keep in mind that certain types of crypto trading are banned in the United Kingdom for retail investors, including derivatives like CFDs, futures, options and perpetual swaps.

Finalizing the List of Best Crypto Exchanges in the UK

Picking the right cryptocurrency exchange depends on what you want to do. For beginners, Coinbase is user-friendly but has higher fees. Kraken offers lower fees and advanced features. eToro boasts social features and a mobile app but has a limited crypto selection. PrimeXBT shines with low fees and copy trading but has limited ways to deposit fiat currency. MEXC is a great option for spot trading with 0% fees, but it also has a 2% fee for debit card purchases. Remember, do your research and choose an FCA-regulated crypto exchange for added security.

                    The FBI made a cryptocurrency to catch scammers
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">

                            U.S. authorities are cracking down on crypto scammers by turning their own tactics against them. For the first time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has disclosed that it created a cryptocurrency to bait and capture fraudsters.

The FBI claims the strategy worked, spurring market-manipulation and fraud charges against several crypto companies, including Gotbit, CLS Global, MyTrade, and ZM Quant, as well as 18 individuals. The agency says it seized more than $25 million in crypto, and several trading bots that were allegedly manipulating around 60 cryptocurrencies were shut down.

“What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime,” said Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division.

As part of “Operation Token Mirrors,” the FBI created an Ethereum-based (ETH) cryptocurrency called NexFundAI Token to target fraudulent token developers, promoters, and market makers. The defendants allegedly lured investors with false claims and engaged in wash trading, a deceptive practice where trades are made to create the illusion of heightened market activity and demand. The manipulation inflated token prices, allowing the scammers to sell their holdings at artificially elevated prices. These market manipulators were unaware that the FBI created the token as part of the sting operation.

“This investigation, the first of its kind, identified numerous fraudsters in the cryptocurrency industry. Wash trading has long been outlawed in the financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy. The news comes more than two years after the FBI announced the formation of a cryptocurrency unit within the agency. 

The Securities & Exchange Commission has also filed civil complaints against Gotbit, CLS, ZM Quant, Saitama, and other companies, accusing them of securities law violations. NexFundAI token trading has been disabled, but its price was up by over 1,558% when fraudsters were active.

                            After the criminal implosion of the crypto exchange FTX, many of the company’s executives have been found guilty on various counts of fraud or conspiracy to commit such acts. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, is starting his seven-and-a-half-year fraud sentence today, but not before posting an all-time absurd LinkedIn post (and we’ve seen some wild posts lately).

“I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Inmate at FCI Cumberland!” Salame wrote on LinkedIn. Beneath the boilerplate text, there’s a colorful cartoon of people dancing around a cupcake. 

If you’re on your way to prison for fraud, I guess you might as well try to cope through humor.

Crypto Bitcoin Approval - ETF -US. SEC - Photo Illustration

2024 has been the year of improving trust and investor confidence in crypto with the SEC approval and launch of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for spot bitcoin (BTC) followed by ether (ETH).

The AUM for spot BTC ETFs has the crossed the $50 billion mark in less than a year as both retail and institutional investors adopted this instrument for exposure to crypto. According to data from CoinGlass, spot BTC ETFs have delivered mostly positive net inflows since their launch.

Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow (USD)

Because bitcoin is a volatile asset, and regulatory concerns remain, several TradFi players, especially smaller ones, do not deal directly in spot ETFs. This is one of the remaining barriers to crypto and spot ETFs achieving critical mass.

Though not as accelerated as the SEC claimed in its filing on September 20, the approval of Options on spot BTC ETFs is a key positive development towards fostering greater adoption.

In the SEC’s view, the move will, “help investors to hedge their positions and manage crypto-related risk.”

A Secured BTC Tool For Leverage

When BTC ETF Options go live following the CFTC and OCC approvals, they will represent the first regulated leverage tool for one of the world’s most decentralized and supply-constrained commodities.

Though bitcoin’s non-custodial, deflationary store of value narrative has gained considerable strength over the years, it has so far been unable to capitalize on the liquidity boost that synthetic leverage enables.

Institutions have mostly remained on the sidelines given excessive counterparty risks and lack of redress mechanisms. Retail investors have to rely heavily on inefficient, perpetual or "perps" based instruments for leverage.

As Rich Rines, CoreDAO contributor, highlights, "Following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the traditional financial world has been searching for more flexible ways to engage with bitcoin. Up to this point, traditional institutions have only been able to buy and hold via ETFs. They earn no yield on their Bitcoin and face rigid limitations in terms of financial flexibility. Options are one of the first ways traditional institutions can increase exposure, manage risks, and generate income with Bitcoin. Until institutions can earn yield via Bitcoin ETFs, options will be an invaluable tool in the toolbelt for sophisticated traditional institutions."

The prospect of securing longer-term incentives for stakeholders to move beyond speculation with mote sophisticated hedging tools is one of the biggest anticipated benefits of the Options approval.

Unique Divine, ceo of Nibiru, says, “The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January ended a decade-long wait. Billions in institutional inflows followed. This was only the beginning. With each step forward, momentum built, driving the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs in July. Now, we’re on the cusp of a new era. Digital assets, once fringe, are evolving into regulated investment vehicles. Accessible. Mainstream. For everyone.”

Unlocking Secondary Financial Products

Spot BTC ETF Options might be the first, but they surely won’t be the last. ETH ETFs, and possibly even SOL or other altcoin ETFs in the future, will inevitably get Options-based instruments in some capacity sooner or later.

Against this backdrop, the approval of BTC ETF Options will further contribute to the virtuous feedback loop where more trust brings more liquidity into the space, which further improves trust and demand for a wide range of secondary products.

Abhitej Singh, founder of Filament Finance, notes, “Given their time aspect, among other factors, Options provide a solid foundation for all kinds of financial derivatives, which can be a massive value unlock in the context of DeFi. With products like defined-outcome ETFs, premium income funds, tail risk ETFs, etc., bitcoin holders will now get loads of opportunities to use their bitcoin to generate value without selling them."

Generating passive or low-risk income of BTC is an important factor in boosting the asset’s utilization ratio, which is currently as low as 0.2 percent according to Grayscale.

The launch of Options will help catalyze the move that spot ETFs have already started. It represents a trillion-dollar opportunity, but more importantly, strengthening bitcoin’s value proposition will inevitably improve crypto’s value proposition as a whole. If not by way of competition, then simply by trickle effect and market rotation.

Alongside other bullish macro-economic and regulatory developments like the Fed’s much-awaited rate cut signaling the easing cycle and the Bank of New York's market entry as a bitcoin custodian for ETF providers, the approval of Options on spot ETFs marks another milestone for crypto’s journey to mass retail.

While this is likely to produce net positive results, it’s also helps to ensure that crypto’s foundational values and principles remain intact in the face of increasing institutional participation.

Shibtoshi, founder of SilentSwap, says, “Institutional participation and political attention are welcome from a business and growth standpoint, but now is also the time to hold crypto’s core vision in high regard. The goal is to build decentralized, community-oriented tools with institution-level security and stability. Otherwise, it won’t be long before crypto’s fate becomes the same as Web2’s.”

Adds Paxful ceo, Roshan Dharia, “Publicly traded bitcoin options are a vital tool for the maturing cryptocurrency market, offering both hedging opportunities and greater price discovery. At Paxful, we see these instruments as part of a larger ecosystem that enhances liquidity and provides institutional and retail investors alike more sophisticated strategies for managing risk. We believe these advancements ultimately strengthen the market, making crypto a more attractive, stable, and robust asset class globally.”

For the BTC or crypto-backed financial ecosystem to realize its potential, it’s important to not lose sight of the broader mission amidst the frenzy of institutional validation. The endgame is a more holistic environment, where investors get the benefits of decentralization and cutting-edge technologies with the convenience and seamlessness of many of today's traditional markets.

Spot BTC ETF Options can push the industry forward in this direction. Whether they actually will, remains to be seen.

                    Understanding Bitcoin ETFs: A beginner’s guide (Part 2)
                </h3>

                            Last week, we introduced our 3-part series on Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), discussing how this crypto investment fund works and the different types available to new investors. Today, we shift our focus to the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs, comparing them to other investment options.

Bitcoin ETFs offer several advantages that make them an attractive option for investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market.

Accessibility is one of the primary benefits. By investing in a Bitcoin ETF, individuals can easily buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or mutual funds. This eliminates the need to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges, which can be complex and intimidating for new investors. Moreover, Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to avoid the challenges of securely storing and managing Bitcoin, as the ETF provider handles all custody and security concerns.

Regulatory oversight is another significant advantage. Bitcoin ETFs operate under strict regulations set by financial authorities, providing investors with a level of protection that is often lacking in the unregulated cryptocurrency market. This regulatory framework can enhance investor confidence, knowing that their investments are subject to oversight and compliance standards. Furthermore, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by regulatory bodies like the SEC signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment class.

Lastly, diversification is an important benefit that Bitcoin ETFs offer. Investors can include Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment portfolio without needing to purchase directly and hold the asset. This allows for a balanced approach to investing, where Bitcoin can act as a hedge against traditional market volatility while still being accessible to those who prefer a more traditional investment strategy. For example, during periods of stock market downturns, Bitcoin’s performance may offset losses, providing stability to the overall portfolio.

Risks of Bitcoin ETFs

While Bitcoin ETFs present several benefits, they also come with their own set of risks and challenges that investors should be aware of.

Volatility is perhaps the most significant risk associated with Bitcoin and, by extension, Bitcoin ETFs. The price of Bitcoin can experience dramatic fluctuations in short periods. This volatility can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic trends. Investors need to be prepared for the possibility of significant price swings when investing in Bitcoin ETFs.

Market risks are another consideration. Although Bitcoin ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight, they still carry risks associated with the underlying asset. The performance of a Bitcoin ETF is directly tied to the price movements of Bitcoin, meaning that adverse market conditions affecting Bitcoin can impact the ETF’s value. Additionally, investors should be mindful of management fees and expenses associated with the ETF, which can eat into returns over time.

Regulatory changes also pose a risk to Bitcoin ETFs. As governments and regulatory bodies continue to assess and develop frameworks for cryptocurrencies, changes in regulations could impact the operation and profitability of Bitcoin ETFs. Potential regulatory shifts could lead to new compliance requirements or even restrictions on trading, which may affect investor confidence and market participation.

Comparing Bitcoin ETFs with Other Investment Options

When considering an investment in Bitcoin, it’s essential to understand how Bitcoin ETFs compare to other investment options, such as direct Bitcoin ownership, Bitcoin trusts, and Bitcoin futures contracts.

Direct bitcoin ownership allows investors to purchase and hold Bitcoin in a digital wallet. This method provides complete control over the asset and the potential for direct participation in the cryptocurrency market. However, it also comes with additional responsibilities, such as securing private keys, managing wallets, and navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges. For many, the risks and technical challenges associated with direct ownership may outweigh the benefits.

Bitcoin trusts are investment funds that directly hold Bitcoin. Investors purchase shares of the trust, which represent a proportionate ownership stake in the underlying Bitcoin. They offer a regulated way to invest in Bitcoin but may trade at a premium or discount to the actual Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. They offer leverage but can be highly risky due to their speculative nature and the potential for margin calls.

By comparing these options, investors can assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of each and choose the one that aligns best with their investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant step forward in making cryptocurrency investments accessible and secure for a wider audience. By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and managing the cryptocurrency directly, ETFs provide a convenient and regulated way to participate in the growing digital asset market.

While there are risks, such as market volatility and regulatory changes, the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs—like accessibility, regulatory oversight, and diversification—make them an attractive option for many investors. As interest in cryptocurrencies continues to rise, Bitcoin ETFs will likely play an important role in shaping the future of how people invest in digital assets.

Next week, we’ll take a deeper dive into ETFs and how they are transforming investment strategies for both individual and institutional investors.

                    Dubai cracks down on crypto firms for regulatory violations
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Dubai’s regulatory authority overseeing virtual assets has escalated its enforcement actions against several cryptocurrency firms operating in violation of local regulations. The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which governs virtual asset activities in the emirate, imposed fines on seven entities, citing breaches of licensing requirements and improper marketing practices. This move is part of an ongoing effort to bolster oversight of the burgeoning crypto industry, reinforcing Dubai’s stance as a globally recognized hub for digital assets while ensuring compliance with strict regulatory frameworks.

VARA’s recent enforcement, which includes fines ranging between $13,600 and $27,200 per company, signals the regulator’s determination to clamp down on unregulated entities operating without appropriate licenses. The fined companies were also accused of marketing virtual asset services without adhering to VARA’s stringent advertising guidelines, which require clear disclaimers about the risks associated with digital asset investments. These firms have been ordered to cease their crypto-related activities immediately.

The fines and cease-and-desist orders come as part of VARA’s broader crackdown on entities seeking to exploit regulatory gaps. The regulator has reiterated its commitment to maintaining a transparent and secure environment for investors, warning the public to avoid engaging with firms that are not licensed to offer virtual asset services. The regulatory authority emphasized the importance of safeguarding stakeholders from the potential financial and reputational risks posed by unlicensed operations.

This latest action from VARA follows several months of heightened scrutiny over the marketing of crypto-related products in Dubai. In September, the regulator introduced new advertising guidelines aimed at mitigating the risks of misleading promotions. These guidelines mandate that all marketing materials include clear warnings about the volatility and potential loss of value of virtual assets, a measure aimed at promoting responsible practices within the industry.

Dubai’s rapid rise as a major player in the global crypto market has attracted numerous companies seeking to leverage the emirate’s favorable regulatory environment. However, authorities are keen to balance this growth with robust regulatory oversight to prevent the market from being undermined by bad actors. VARA’s enforcement actions highlight the emirate’s intent to build a sustainable and secure crypto ecosystem, where only licensed and compliant firms can operate.

As the crypto sector continues to grow globally, Dubai’s proactive stance is likely to position the city as a model for other jurisdictions seeking to regulate the industry. By tightening its regulatory grip, VARA is ensuring that firms operating in the region uphold the highest standards of transparency and investor protection. However, the move also signals that non-compliant entities will face significant legal and financial consequences if they fail to meet the regulatory demands.

While VARA has not publicly disclosed the names of the seven fined companies, industry analysts believe the regulator is likely conducting further investigations to identify other potential violators. The enforcement measures underscore Dubai’s commitment to fostering a safe and well-regulated environment for both investors and service providers in the virtual assets space.

                    Ex-CEO of disgraced crypto firm FTX actually announced his prison stint on LinkedIn
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, has been seeking a two-month delay in the start of his prison sentence due to injuries from a dog attacking him. However, it appears he has come to terms with his situation. In a recent LinkedIn post, he announced his new role as an inmate at FCI Cumberland. 

For those unfamiliar, the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland is a medium-security prison for male inmates in Maryland. Salame is set to report to the facility on Friday to begin serving his seven-and-a-half-year sentence.

Salame was a close aide to disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and served as the head of FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary, where he played a significant role in the company’s political fundraising efforts. Earlier this year, a U.S. court sentenced him to 90 months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $6 million in forfeiture and more than $5 million in restitution.

Following FTX’s collapse in November 2022, Salame became the first deputy of Sam Bankman-Fried to be sentenced. The 30-year-old was the head of FTX’s subsidiary in the Bahamas, where the crypto exchange was based; last year, he pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws and operating an unlicensed business in his work with FTX. Prior to the crypto exchange’s failure, Salame lived a lavish lifestyle of snapping up expensive cars, private jets, and fancy restaurants, per media reports.

Earlier this year, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His close associates—Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh—pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Caroline has been sentenced to two years in prison and is scheduled to surrender on or after November 7. Singh is set to receive his sentence on October 30, while Wang’s sentencing is scheduled for November 20.

                    A crypto king is now the prime minister of a tiny country
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            In both politics and crypto, one rule stands: Expect the unexpected. So what do you get when they join forces? A chaotic cocktail where votes and virtual coins fly faster than you can say “blockchain government.”

In a recent blockchain-based election, the micronation of Liberland in Eastern Europe has chosen crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun as the Speaker of its Congress. Following this, Liberland’s President Vít Jedlička nominated Sun to serve as acting Prime Minister. Sun, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency world and founder of the Tron blockchain network, now holds two key positions in this self-proclaimed libertarian state.

Under the leadership of Liberland President Vít Jedlička, several prominent figures have been elected to the Liberland Congress. Among them are Indian tech entrepreneur Evan Luthra, journalist Jillian Godsil, Dorian Jakov Stern Vukotic (the first to enter Liberland in 2023 and tech lead of the Liberland blockchain team), Bitcoin advocate Navid Saberin, and law graduate Michal Ptáčník.

Justin Sun is a controversial figure

The Chinese entrepreneur has gained notoriety for his outspoken nature and involvement in various controversies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Sun and his companies for alleged securities fraud, claiming they manipulated the price of Tron’s tokens and conspired to distribute billions of crypto assets while artificially inflating trade volumes to attract investors. 

However, Liberland President Vít Jedlička maintains that Sun’s blockchain expertise aligns with the nation’s mission to harness decentralized technology.

What is the history of Liberland?

Liberland is a self-proclaimed libertarian micronation founded in 2015 by former Czech politician Vít Jedlička, who serves as its President. Situated on the western bank of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia, Liberland covers just 7 square kilometers (2.7 square miles)—a mere speck compared to New York City, which is 112 times larger.

This territory emerged as a disputed area after the breakup of Yugoslavia and is not claimed by either Croatia or Serbia. Organized around libertarian principles, Liberland boasts no mandatory military service and no taxes. However, the country remains unrecognized by the United Nations, raising questions about its legitimacy.

                    The FBI secretly created a coin to investigate crypto pump-and-dump schemes
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The FBI created a cryptocurrency as part of an investigation into price manipulation in crypto markets, the government revealed Wednesday. The FBI’s Ethereum-based token, NexFundAI, was created with the help of “cooperating witnesses.”

As a result of the investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three “market makers” and nine people for allegedly engaging in schemes to boost the prices of certain crypto assets. The Department of Justice charged 18 people and entities for “widespread fraud and manipulation” in crypto markets.

The defendants allegedly made false claims about their tokens and executed so-called “wash trades” to create the impression of an active trading market, prosecutors claim. The three market makers — ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade — allegedly wash traded or conspired to wash trade on behalf of NexFundAI, an Ethereum-based token they didn’t realize was created by the FBI. 

“What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime,” Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston Division, said in a statement. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.”

Liu Zhou, a “market maker” working with MyTradeMM, allegedly told promoters of NexFundAI that MyTradeMM was better than its competitors because they “control the pump and dump” allowing them to “do inside trading easily.”

An FBI spokesperson told Coindesk that there was limited trading activity on the coin but didn’t share additional information. On a Wednesday press call, Joshua Levy, the the Acting US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said trading on the token was disabled, according to Coindesk.

The DOJ has reportedly secured $25 million from “fraudulent proceeds” that will be returned to investors.

                    Best Wallet for NFT: Plus Wallet Rewards Traders & Web3 Gamers for Every Move, While Atomic Wallet Enjoys a Legal Win
                </h3>

                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Atomic Wallet recently celebrated a significant legal victory as a U.S. federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit related to a $100 million hack.

Atomic Wallet Scores Legal Win in $100M Hack Lawsuit

Atomic Wallet has secured a major legal win as a U.S. federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit tied to a $100 million hack. The ruling, made by Colorado district court judge Philip Brimmer, highlighted that the court lacked jurisdiction over the Estonian company, noting insufficient ties to Colorado.

The lawsuit, initiated in August 2023, alleged that Atomic Wallet and its executives were responsible for the breach. While the majority of claims were dismissed, the court allowed plaintiffs a chance to further justify the inclusion of one co-founder in the case.

Web3 gaming holds exciting potential, yet many gamers are still navigating the complexities of crypto wallets. A recent report found that while over 64% of players value competition, the intricate wallet setup can be a barrier to entry.

                    Thailand opens doors for mutual and private funds to invest in digital assets
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially given the green light for mutual and private funds to explore investments in digital assets. This regulatory shift, seen as a significant development in the nation’s financial landscape, aims to provide more diverse investment opportunities, especially in cryptocurrency, to both domestic and foreign markets. The SEC’s decision comes as global interest in digital assets and crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to grow.

Under the new regulations, mutual funds in Thailand will now be allowed to allocate a portion of their capital toward cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with crypto ETFs listed in foreign markets like the US. The rules also extend to private funds targeting high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, who are granted more flexibility, including uncapped exposure to digital assets. The intention is to attract larger investors by providing them with the freedom to diversify their portfolios without the limitations typically imposed on traditional retail funds.

The SEC’s introduction of these new rules follows calls for a revision of investment criteria to align with global developments in the digital asset space. Notably, the SEC emphasized the importance of fiduciary responsibility among fund managers, urging them to carefully assess the risks associated with investing in such volatile assets while ensuring transparency in how these investments are managed.

Mutual funds targeting retail investors will be subject to specific limits to manage risk exposure. These funds will only be able to allocate up to 15% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. In contrast, private funds for wealthy clients face no such restrictions, offering them the flexibility to make bolder moves in the crypto market. The SEC stressed that all funds, regardless of investor type, should adhere to international best practices, including asset valuation, risk management, and proper disclosure to clients.

As part of its regulatory overhaul, the SEC is also focusing on supporting infrastructure around digital asset investments. This includes updating guidelines on asset custody, valuation, and information disclosure, particularly for overseas investments. Additionally, the holding period for high-risk assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been limited to five business days, which is aimed at reducing the risks associated with short-term volatility.

Thailand’s move mirrors similar initiatives by other countries in the region. Taiwan, for instance, has also begun allowing investments in foreign crypto ETFs, suggesting a broader trend of regulatory adaptation in Asia toward the burgeoning digital asset market. The global push for increased institutional involvement in cryptocurrency is reflected in these regulatory shifts, as countries look to stay competitive while safeguarding investors.

The regulatory revision is expected to bolster Thailand’s position as a regional financial hub, especially for crypto and digital assets. While the country has already seen significant growth in its digital asset market, these new regulations are expected to further enhance investor confidence and spur greater institutional involvement. For asset managers, this presents new opportunities to offer innovative products tailored to the evolving needs of their clients, particularly in a financial environment increasingly defined by the rise of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

Fund managers have welcomed the move, recognizing the growing importance of digital assets in the global investment landscape. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by such a volatile market, emphasizing the need for robust risk management frameworks. As institutional and high-net-worth investors begin to explore the possibilities offered by these new investment channels, the broader market is likely to witness more integration of digital assets into traditional financial products.

                    VanEck to Infuse Funding for Early Stage Crypto, AI Businesses
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            As the number of startups in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow, the demand for funding to support these emerging firms has also increased. VanEck, a global investment management firm based in New York City, has announced plans to invest $30 million (roughly Rs. 258 crore) into promising crypto and AI startups. Currently, VanEck's market cap stands at $26.9 billion (roughly Rs. 2,25,869 crore).

As per an official statement by VanEck released this week, the investment pool for early-age startups has launched under the VanEck Ventures brand.

Commenting on the development, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck highlighted that the company was a pioneer in recognising the potential of gold investments in 1968. Today, VanEck sees similar disruptive potential in Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency, currently trading at $61,094 (around ₹51.2 lakh), according to CoinMarketCap.Surviving Crypto Volatility: Insiders Share Mental Health Tips for Investors

“We look forward to supporting founders of what we believe are some of the most disruptive companies in fintech—those building the future of finance,” the company chief noted.

The company expects to make up to 35 investments from the investment fund. Selected startups will get access to funding within the range of $500,000 (roughly Rs. 4.19 crore) to $1 million (roughly Rs. 8.39 crore).

Startups working around tokenised assets, web-linked financial marketplaces, and stablecoins-based payment systems have a good chance of acquiring required funding from VanEck Ventures. In its official statement, the company said it has already released investments for four startups from this fund – details of which are yet to be announced.Crypto.com Sues US SEC After Receiving Legal Threat from Regulator

“As several on-chain utilities, focused on programmability and compliance, come to market with growing regulatory clarity, it's never been a more exciting time to build. Our goal is to be a long-term partner to bold founders defining the next phase of blockchain utility,” said Juan Lopez, General Partner at VanEck Ventures.

As of August 31, 2024, VanEck says it managed approximately $113.9 billion (roughly Rs. 9,56,459 crore) in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts.

This year, crypto-focussed startups reportedly managed to see bigger investments from venture capital firms in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the first. In a recently released report by PitchBook, a total of $2.7 billion (roughly Rs. 22,672 crore) was invested into crypto startups between April and June this year via 503 deals.

In addition to VanEck, other firms backing early-stage Web3 startups include Paradigm, Brevan Howard Asset Management, Framework Ventures, Maven 11, Dragonfly, and Haun Ventures.

                    Key DeFi service Uniswap launches its own blockchain
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            “Unichain will initially have one-second block times, and will later be optimized to meet 200-250 milliseconds block times. This will feel like a near-instant transaction experience for the user,” said Uniswap Labs in a statement.

Layer 2 blockchains, knowns as L2s, have proliferated in the last few years and include services like Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base. They work by compiling transactions and recording them as a batch onto the main Ethereum blockchain, a process that minimizes fees and avoids delays due to congestion.

The decision by Uniswap Labs to launch an L2 of its own is significant because Uniswap—an open source protocol akin to SMTP for email—is the most popular tool for DeFi, which relies on modular, Lego-like tools to carry out trades without a centralized authority. Using the email analogy, Unichain is like Gmail or another client built on the open protocol.

In an interview with Fortune, Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherine Lader, said Unichain will in time make using DeFi less clunky for users and also increase liquidity across the industry. A former banker with BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, Lader predicts DeFi style tools will increasingly be adopted by the world of traditional finance.

According to Lader, Uniswap Labs built Unichain with a mind for the Apple adage that building great software requires great hardware, and that the company’s philosophy is based on simultaneously pursuing the crypto ideals of speed, low cost and decentralization. Unichain itself is built on the L2 technology known as Optimism, which is used by a popular L2 of the same name and by Base among others.

Uniswap was created in 2018 by self-taught programmer Hayden Adams, who has since developed a second and third version of the protocol. In late 2022, Uniswap Labs raised a $165 million Series B funding round that at the time valued it around the same amount.

Uniswap created the new L2 blockchain with the help of the DeFi research and development organizations Flashbots and OP Labs.

                    BNB and XRP prices hit setbacks, new DeFi token DTX Exchange (DTX) takes over bullish momentum
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The market is showing a variety of signs for different tokens, bullish momentum for some and bearish for others. BNB and Ripple (XRP) seem to be on the bearish end of the market, as their price predictions show weakness in the bullish potential.

But there’s the DTX Exchange (DTX) token for traders to recoup their losses in 2024. The token is strongly bullish, and it is receiving both analyst and investor support. Here’s why!

BNB price is losing bullish momentum

BNB has fallen out of its bullish momentum from September 2024 despite many traders assuming CZ’s release would keep the token in business. It’s still gathering momentum for the average daily gains, but the effort seems to be waning. 

BNB was rejected at its $612 resistance as September rolled to an end, and the token has since slipped to lower support. Last Thursday, FXStreet reported that BNB could be stuck with the bears if the token closes below $548.

While BNB didn’t close business below $548 throughout the week, it hasn’t trended to the levels that would take it to bullish trends. The BNB price is currently stuck at about $569, some way off its resistance at $583.

XRP slows down as Ripple suffers even more SEC drawbacks

The XRP token has traded in a range for over two years since the SEC leveled charges of the sale of unregistered securities against the blockchain. The lawsuit has dragged on long enough, and many of the investors are fed up with the proceedings so far.

August 2024 came with some good news, as the legal battle seemed to be arriving at some resolution at last. The SEC looked to be conceding more than they bargained for, and Ripple Labs would only be paying $125 million in fines.

Apparently, that’s not enough for the commission. They filed an appeal against the XRP last week, restating Ripple’s status as an unregistered security and increasing the volatility on the XRP charts. XRP is worth $0.53, and the gains have been fluctuating since Thursday, October 3, 2024, with no noticeable bullish momentum in sight.

There’s a lot of volatility to deal with on the crypto charts; DTX Exchange is already looking very appealing to Binance and Ripple investors.

Expanding DeFi horizons: DTX Exchange’s innovative approach

DTX Exchange is a decentralized exchange platform offering traders a chance at bigger, better profits than the average DEX.

The platform features a truly diverse range of instruments, including equity products, foreign currencies, and regular crypto coins for trading.

Still, decentralized finance doesn’t end there for DTX. The platform has Real-World Assets trading as an integral part of the blockchain, where users can access real commodities like gold, real estate, and crude oil. Here, they trade them on a token-backed basis, owning units of such commodities and leveraging them accordingly.

There are also staking rewards for building the economic security of the DTX Exchange platform. For your staked assets, you draw some 18% APY as passive income.

DTX Exchange to dominate the ‘Uptober’ rally

The DTX token is selling at $0.06 now in Stage 3 of the presale, and the price will go up to $0.08 in Stage 4, giving investors a 33% ROI head start in ‘Uptober.”

The tokens come with a cumulative 100% presale ROI from here till launch day when its price goes up to $0.12. DTX could very well offer the most stable crypto profits for the year. With many top altcoins in reverse, DTX Exchange is tipped to run free in the DeFi space.

                    Retail Investors Interested in Crypto, But Worried About Volatility: IOSCO
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Retail investors are showing a strong interest in cryptocurrencies despite the speculative and volatile nature of these virtual assets. The finding was highlighted in a report released by the Board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The Madrid, Spain-based body said it surveyed 24 jurisdictions to compile this report titled “Investor Education on Crypto-Assets". The report, which was released this week, emphasises that the rising interest of large capital-equipped investors in crypto should be directed through focus on crypto awareness and education.

In its report, the IOSCO stated that even in 2022, when the crypto sector's valuation fell below $1 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,67,09,363 crore), retail investors continued to invest in crypto assets. This trend was evident not only among retail investors in advanced economies but also among those in emerging markets.

“Since 2020, the crypto-asset space has continued to evolve and, despite volatility in the market, which experienced a major downturn during the 2022 ‘crypto winter', retail investors continue to invest in the crypto-asset market, these investors tend to be younger and more demographically diverse,” the report said.Private Banks in Taiwan Seek to Explore Virtual Asset Custody Business

The report has brought to light that many of these younger investors from the retails sector are gathering their investment-related information from unauthorised, random sources. This practice, the IOSCO fears, can lead them into a situation of financial turmoil.

“These investors often rely on social media for investment information and tend to overestimate their investment knowledge and experience,” the report said.

The financial organisation asserts that governments must accelerate efforts to draft comprehensive crypto regulations tailored to their respective economies. Additionally, the report emphasises the need for investor education regarding the protections offered by regulatory frameworks and the risks associated with investing in non-compliant crypto assets.Here's How Meta's Hyperscape Turns Phone Cameras into Metaverse Portals

IOSCO also identified several factors contributing to the gap between retail investors' interest in crypto assets and their reluctance to engage fully. These factors include extreme price volatility, potential losses, system malfunctions, hacking risks, fears of losing private keys, the proliferation of fake crypto assets, and the lack of consumer protection.

“Given the widespread lack of compliance in the crypto-asset space, fraudulent activity continues to be prevalent, and investors remain at significant risk of loss. Investors, including those new to investing, may not be as aware about how to avoid or look out for fraud when investing in this space. Being aware and cautious about the continuing prevalence of fraud remains an important message that regulators need to regularly communicate to and reinforce with investors,” the report noted.

Echoing findings from various research firms and legal institutions, including the FBI, IOSCO has recognised the increasing prevalence of crypto-related fraud in recent years.

The report highlights a significant rise in investment fraud, Ponzi schemes, exit scams, pump-and-dump schemes, and market manipulation tactics employed by cybercriminals, urging investors to conduct due diligence before engaging with unfamiliar crypto resources. For younger investors, the report cautions that FOMO should not drive them to hastily invest in these speculative and largely unregulated assets.

IOSCO is currently working to implement a crypto framework across its member jurisdictions, serving as a forum for national securities regulators and claims to have 130 jurisdictions under its umbrella. SEBI, India is also one of the members on the IOSCO Board.

                    FBI Created a Crypto Token to Bait Pump-and-Dump Scammers
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The FBI created its own cryptocurrency company and crypto token in order to bait fraudsters who would make fake trades in order to boost the price before cashing out, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI operation, dubbed Operation Token Mirrors, was unprecedented in the crypto space and 18 individuals and entities have been charged over their alleged fraud and manipulation in indictments announced on Wednesday.

Three firms, ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade, allegedly offered their services to engage in what’s called wash trading of the FBI crypto token, along with about 60 other coins, to make it appear that there was tremendous interest. A fourth firm, Gotbit, allegedly engaged in similar wash trading but didn’t trade the FBI’s dedicated token. The wash trades were made using “multiple trading bots,” according to the DOJ, which have since been deactivated, and at least $35 million in crypto has been seized.

The crypto company and token created by the FBI was called NexFundAI and was built on the Ethereum blockchain. The token had a dedicated website that looked identical to any of the other sites created for cryptocurrencies that are created every day, but it now includes a banner at the top that reads, “This website was created at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of an investigation into cryptocurrency fraud and market manipulation. For more information, please click here.” The link for “click here” directs visitors to the DOJ press release about the indictments.

The indictments include Telegram and WhatsApp chats between the alleged fraudsters, along with the memes and GIFs they were sharing about their activity.

The indictment against CLS Global’s Andrey Zhorzhes also includes quotes from a video chat he had with the FBI (with the agency appearing under the guise of NexFundAI), where Zhorzhes explained how his company’s services work:

 “The thing that we can help with is volume creation. We can help with volume generation so you guys are able to meet exchange requirements, if you are applying for a tier 1 exchange.” “We have an algorithm that … basically does self-trades, buying and selling, and the only expenses you have are the gas fee and the exchange fee.” “We do that from multiple wallets so it’s not visible … it looks like organic buying and selling that is happening … so it does not look like an algo[rithm] is trading, because if it is obvious, then it doesn’t make much sense.” “The idea of volume generation is creating some volume on the decentralized exchange so the token looks organic and looks live and people get interested in trading it.” “We do that by transferring the funds into multiple wallets, that could be as many as you guys wish . . . from which we do the buying and selling . . . and generate some desired number for you. We decide some number we wish to generate per day . . . can be 100,200,300k, doesn’t matter, and then we generate these number[s]… on a 24-hour timeframe.” “It’s very hard to track…. We’ve been doing that for many clients.” “I know that it’s wash trading and I know people might not be happy about it.” 

“What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime. ‘Operation Token Mirrors’ targeted nefarious token developers, promoters, and market makers in the crypto space,” Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Boston Division, said in a press release. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.”

“The FBI took the unprecedented step of creating its very own cryptocurrency token and company to identify, disrupt, and bring these alleged fraudsters to justice,” Cohen continued.

Of the 18 individuals and entities charged by the DOJ, so far four have pleaded guilty, and another has agreed to plead guilty. Three other defendants in Texas, the UK, and Portugal have been apprehended this week, according to the agency.

Those charged so far include:

 Aleksei Andriunin, Fedor Kedrov, Qawi Jalili, Gotbit Consulting LLC (Gotbit) Riqui Liu, Baijun Ou, ZM Quant Investment LTD (ZM Quant) Andrey Zhorzhes, CLS Global FZC, LLC (CLS) Liu Zhou, MyTrade MM Manpreet Kohli, Haroon Mohsini, Nam Tran, Max Hernandez, Russell Armand, Vy Pham, Saitama LLC (Saitama) Robo Inu Finance (Robo Inu) Michael Thompson, VZZN Bradley Beatty, Lillian Finance LLC (Lillian Finance) 

Will these charges deter future scammers? That remains to be seen. But in the two hours after the indictments were announced Wednesday, dozens of new tokens with the name NexFundAI were created, according to a search of DexScreener.

We’re going to guess the crypto space will continue to be a Wild West of finance with more scammers than anyone can properly count. Anyone who bought or sold tokens from any of the companies being charged, including the FBI’s own token, is encouraged to contact the FBI as a potential victim of a crime. But crypto fans are pointing out on social media that it’s pretty rich for the FBI to create a scam token and then implore the people harmed by that same scam to seek help from the FBI.
