                Atomic Wallet recently celebrated a significant legal victory as a U.S. federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit related to a $100 million hack.

As the industry grapples with such complexities, Web3 gaming is poised for growth but faces hurdles, particularly with gamers struggling to use crypto wallets. This is where Plus Wallet steps in, offering a solution that simplifies asset management and caters to both traders and NFT enthusiasts.

Gamers can also grow their earnings through Plus Wallet’s Swap to Earn and Refer to Earn programs. With its simplicity and reward system, Plus Wallet positions itself as one of the best wallets for NFT and crypto assets.

Atomic Wallet Scores Legal Win in $100M Hack Lawsuit

Atomic Wallet has secured a major legal win as a U.S. federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit tied to a $100 million hack. The ruling, made by Colorado district court judge Philip Brimmer, highlighted that the court lacked jurisdiction over the Estonian company, noting insufficient ties to Colorado.

The lawsuit, initiated in August 2023, alleged that Atomic Wallet and its executives were responsible for the breach. While the majority of claims were dismissed, the court allowed plaintiffs a chance to further justify the inclusion of one co-founder in the case.

How Web3 Gaming Can Thrive with Improved Accessibility

Web3 gaming holds exciting potential, yet many gamers are still navigating the complexities of crypto wallets. A recent report found that while over 64% of players value competition, the intricate wallet setup can be a barrier to entry. Approximately 32% of gamers admitted they were unsure how to start in Web3 games, and 11% viewed crypto wallets as too complicated.

However, the shift towards skill-based rewards in Web3 gaming is promising, as it attracts players who want to be recognized for their abilities. As wallet providers work to simplify these processes, the future of Web3 gaming looks bright, with greater accessibility on the horizon.
