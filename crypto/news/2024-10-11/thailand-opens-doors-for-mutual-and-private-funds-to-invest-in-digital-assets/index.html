                Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially given the green light for mutual and private funds to explore investments in digital assets. This regulatory shift, seen as a significant development in the nation’s financial landscape, aims to provide more diverse investment opportunities, especially in cryptocurrency, to both domestic and foreign markets. The SEC’s decision comes as global interest in digital assets and crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to grow.

Under the new regulations, mutual funds in Thailand will now be allowed to allocate a portion of their capital toward cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with crypto ETFs listed in foreign markets like the US. The rules also extend to private funds targeting high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, who are granted more flexibility, including uncapped exposure to digital assets. The intention is to attract larger investors by providing them with the freedom to diversify their portfolios without the limitations typically imposed on traditional retail funds.

The SEC’s introduction of these new rules follows calls for a revision of investment criteria to align with global developments in the digital asset space. Notably, the SEC emphasized the importance of fiduciary responsibility among fund managers, urging them to carefully assess the risks associated with investing in such volatile assets while ensuring transparency in how these investments are managed.

Mutual funds targeting retail investors will be subject to specific limits to manage risk exposure. These funds will only be able to allocate up to 15% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. In contrast, private funds for wealthy clients face no such restrictions, offering them the flexibility to make bolder moves in the crypto market. The SEC stressed that all funds, regardless of investor type, should adhere to international best practices, including asset valuation, risk management, and proper disclosure to clients.

As part of its regulatory overhaul, the SEC is also focusing on supporting infrastructure around digital asset investments. This includes updating guidelines on asset custody, valuation, and information disclosure, particularly for overseas investments. Additionally, the holding period for high-risk assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been limited to five business days, which is aimed at reducing the risks associated with short-term volatility.

Thailand’s move mirrors similar initiatives by other countries in the region. Taiwan, for instance, has also begun allowing investments in foreign crypto ETFs, suggesting a broader trend of regulatory adaptation in Asia toward the burgeoning digital asset market. The global push for increased institutional involvement in cryptocurrency is reflected in these regulatory shifts, as countries look to stay competitive while safeguarding investors.

The regulatory revision is expected to bolster Thailand’s position as a regional financial hub, especially for crypto and digital assets. While the country has already seen significant growth in its digital asset market, these new regulations are expected to further enhance investor confidence and spur greater institutional involvement. For asset managers, this presents new opportunities to offer innovative products tailored to the evolving needs of their clients, particularly in a financial environment increasingly defined by the rise of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

Fund managers have welcomed the move, recognizing the growing importance of digital assets in the global investment landscape. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by such a volatile market, emphasizing the need for robust risk management frameworks. As institutional and high-net-worth investors begin to explore the possibilities offered by these new investment channels, the broader market is likely to witness more integration of digital assets into traditional financial products.
