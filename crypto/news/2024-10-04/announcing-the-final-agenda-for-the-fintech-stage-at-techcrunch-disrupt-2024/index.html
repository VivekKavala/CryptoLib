                We’re incredibly excited to announce the final agenda for our dedicated Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. It joins Space, SaaS, AI and Builders as the other industry-focused stages — all under one big roof. As the fintech industry evolves, new opportunities abound for founders, investors, and customers. Areas such as mobile banking, global payroll, digital payments, embedded finance, and cryptocurrency are only growing in coming years. Open banking is still gaining speed in the United States as well. At Disrupt’s Fintech Stage, hear from leaders across the industry about what challenges they’ve faced so far and where the opportunities lie. Check out the final agenda below. The complete Fintech Stage agenda Finding the Consensus of Crypto VC With Morgan Beller (NFX), Will Nuelle (Galaxy VC), and Haseeb Qureshi (Dragonfly Capital) In the crypto space, it’s time to scale. All signs point toward a period of growth with high market prices, a more favorable regulatory landscape and a large ecosystem of scaling solutions that work. So let’s talk with investors who have backed some of the most influential protocols, exchanges, and decentralized apps. What’s the next big thing and what has been the biggest surprise in their investment portfolio? Coinbase’s Onchain Pivot with Base With Jesse Pollak (Base) Base is a secure, low-cost and developer-friendly Ethereum layer-2 blockchain. It is also Coinbase’s most ambitious bet on decentralization. It serves as the home for all of Coinbase’s on-chain products, but anyone can also build decentralized apps on Base. Jesse Pollak is in charge of the ambitious Base project at Coinbase. He will tell us why Coinbase is moving outside of its comfort zone and betting on protocols. How These Neobanks Grew During Challenging Times With Colin Walsh (Varo Bank) and Jason Wilk (Dave) While there have been many digital bank shutdowns in recent years, there are some players that are not only doing well, but thriving. Neobanks Dave and Varo Bank each have millions of customers, growing despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and an increasing number of competitors. What are these companies doing to help them grow during challenging times? And what should we expect from them in the future? We’ll talk to execs to find out. With Tiptop, Postmates Founder Bastian Lehmann Is Hungry for More With Bastian Lehmann (Tiptop) After selling Postmates to Uber for $2.65 billion, Bastian Lehmann is back with Tiptop, a startup that wants to unlock the monetary value of things you already own. Tiptop is building an instant trade-in program that is available at checkout. Retailers can integrate Tiptop as a payment option and Tiptop handles everything from quotes to payouts and fraud prevention. After revolutionizing the modern delivery economy and the food industry, can Bastian Lehmann change how we buy (and sell) things? Future of Work With Corinne Beksha (Check), Marcelo Lebre (Remote), and Josh Reeves (Gusto) Software is eating the world, and companies are hiring global talent more frequently than ever. They want to be able to hire talent in foreign countries and retain employees who want to move abroad. That’s why new global HR startups are helping companies hire people all around the world with local contracts. But can they replace local subsidiaries? BaaS in a Post-Synapse Meltdown World With Itai Damti (Unit), Peter Hazlehurst (Synctera), and Sheetal Parikh (Treasury Prime) The bankruptcy of banking-as-a-service (BaaS) fintech Synapse shows just how treacherous things are for the often-interdependent fintech world when one key player hits trouble. Synapse’s problems have hurt and taken down a number of other startups and affected millions of consumers all over the country. Many believe regulatory clarity is needed moving forward. One analyst says the case of Synapse underscores the need for fintech companies to maintain high operational and compliance standards. This panel looks at the potential impacts the Synapse collapse will have on the future of BaaS.
