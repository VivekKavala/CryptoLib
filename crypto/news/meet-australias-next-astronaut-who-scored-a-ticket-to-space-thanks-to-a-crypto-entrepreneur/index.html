                Eric Philips remembers the day he watched in awe as humans first set foot on the Moon in 1969. "I sat in the gymnasium of my primary school with the entire school â€¦ looking at a tiny little screen [showing] the Apollo astronauts landing on the Moon," the 62-year-old recalled. "And I was captivated ever since." More than five decades on, the Australian explorer is about to embark on his own history-making space adventure. In December, he and three other amateur astronauts are scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on the first-ever human spaceflight to orbit the Earth's polar regions. Once it happens, Mr Philips will become the fourth Australian in space. He'll also be the first Australian to fly on a SpaceX mission. "Here I am kind of reliving that childhood dream." Space mission funded by crypto entrepreneur By his own account, his ticket to space is "the most bizarre opportunity". Mr Philips runs an adventure company that takes clients on ski expeditions to Antarctica and the Arctic. Loading... Two years ago, during an expedition in the Arctic, one of his clients started chatting about space travel. "We talked about what it would be like to fly to the Moon and to Mars," Mr Philips said. "And apparently, I started singing, 'Fly Me to the Moon'. "I think that's what captured his attention for me in particularly." The client was Chun Wang, a wealthy Maltese cryptocurrency entrepreneur. A year after that conversation, Mr Philips received a text message from Mr Wang. "And sort of jokingly, I think I sent him a 'hands up' emoji, and said, 'Well, look, you know, I'm interested'. "Little did I know that I would be the chosen one." 'Earth will be whizzing past us' The mission has been dubbed "Fram2". The name refers to the historic polar vessel Fram, which was used in expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic regions in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Fram2 involves a four-person crew orbiting the planet in SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The team is expected to launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in the second-half of December. "It's quite incredible," Mr Philips said. Mr Wang, who will be mission commander, has funded the trip, although the cost has not been disclosed. Mr Philips, who lives in Victoria, after two decades spent in Tasmania, will act as a mission specialist and medic. The other two members of the crew are Norwegian vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen and German co-pilot Rabea Rogge. The group will spend three to five days in space in a low Earth orbit, hurtling from the north pole to the south pole approximately every 45 minutes. "We are able to open the nose cone of the Dragon capsule, and then we have a cupola â€” a large glass dome â€” which is specifically there for viewing Earth and the cosmos around us." First human X-ray in space Fram2 isn't just an expensive sightseeing tour. The team will be conducting a range of scientific experiments and observations while in orbit. According to a SpaceX announcement last month: "[Mr] Wang aims to use the mission to highlight the crew's explorational spirit, bring a sense of wonder and curiosity to the larger public, and highlight how technology can help push the boundaries of exploration of Earth and through the mission's research." As the capsule passes over the polar regions, those on board will be capturing images and vision of "unusual light emissions resembling auroras". "The crew will study green fragments and mauve ribbons of continuous emissions comparable to the phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), which has been measured at an altitude of approximately 400 to 500 kilometres above Earth's atmosphere," SpaceX said. The crew will also test the effects of space flight on the human body, including capturing the first human-X-ray images in space. "All of which will help in the development of tools needed to prepare humanity for future long-duration space flight," SpaceX said. Mr Philips said further details about their in-flight research would be outlined prior to the trip. "We're going to be very excited to be able to reveal what they are in the coming months." 'Mind-blowingly exciting' adventure awaits SpaceX's Dragon capsule is an autonomous vehicle, meaning there's little those on board will have to do from launch to splash down. But they have still had to undergo stringent medical testing and centrifuge training to ensure they can handle the mission. "I was pretty concerned about that, because I do get chronically motion sick, and that happens every time I get on a ship or a boat to Antarctica," Mr Philips said. "But I performed flawlessly, thankfully, because there's actually no correlation between motion sickness and space sickness." The team has also spent several weeks doing simulated training in a capsule to prepare for potential emergencies. "Nothing can be controlled 100 per cent as much as we like them to be," Mr Philips said. "We just kind of need to deal with those situations if they arise, but it's unlikely they will." For now, Mr Philips is simply focused on the extraordinary adventure that awaits. "The whole thing is mind-blowingly exciting." Fram2 will be SpaceX's thirteenth human space flight, and the sixth commercial mission involving the Dragon capsule. Loading...
