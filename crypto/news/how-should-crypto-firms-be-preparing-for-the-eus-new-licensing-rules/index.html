                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The EU is seeing a proliferation of interest in digital assets LightRocket via Getty Images At the end of this year, the second and final part of the EU’s game-changing new MiCA (Markets in Crypto-assets) regulation will come into force, requiring crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to obtain a license from their domestic regulator. Once licensed, CASPs will have access to the entire EU market, representing around 450 million people, and a huge growth opportunity for the digital asset sector. How should CASPs, including exchanges, brokers, and custodians, be preparing? With 27 member states undergoing the transition, there’s a world of legal detail to get lost in here. But the headline requirements aren’t so complicated. Under Article 60 of the MiCA rules, certain financial institutions that are already regulated under existing EU financial frameworks, such as credit institutions, securities depositories, investment firms, and others, will effectively inherit their status with regard to crypto-asset activities. As such, the only requirement is for them to notify their regulator of the intention to provide digital asset services 40 days in advance of the provision. Regulators in some countries, including the Netherlands and Italy, have issued a procedure for notification or indicated an intention to do so. Others have yet to do so, but even so, the notification requirement is relatively basic for qualifying institutions. Obtaining an EU-wide MiCA License For CASPs that don’t qualify for the Article 60 notification requirement, obtaining a license is the only route to legal operation in the EU after the end of this year. For this, they’ll need to look to the domestic regulator, and the procedure will largely depend on their current license to operate in their home member state. Any new CASP that wants to kick off their service provision from January 1, 2025, will need to apply for a license from scratch. The state of licensing procedures per country largely correlates to the amount of CASP activity already in the country. For example, Germany, France, and Ireland have all issued detailed information, including procedures and timelines. Typically, new CASPs can already begin to engage with domestic regulators by submitting an intention via the regulator’s website.

In some countries, the procedure may be less clear. Some are still clearing the necessary lawmaking procedures to ensure that MiCA can be implemented without conflict with any existing legislation. Intriguingly, Belgium simply has no existing licensed digital asset activities or operators that the regulators need to address. However, in most cases, regulators have indicated a willingness to engage with would-be CASPs, even in the absence of a formal published process, so it’s worth initiating contact. The other category comprises the many hundreds of CASPs that already have a home in a European member state, and the good news is that they benefit from transitional arrangements. This effectively means that any existing regime – or crucially, even the absence of one – can be grandfathered for a period until the regulator can grant MiCA CASP licenses. An Early Mover Advantage What does this mean in practice? A CASP in a country such as the Netherlands, which has never regulated digital assets, can continue providing services to Dutch users within the transitional period until its EU CASP license is granted. CASPs in countries such as France, which operates an existing licensing regime, can also continue providing services to French users throughout the transitional period until their EU CASP license is granted. However, there are two important points to note here. Firstly, the transitional arrangements only apply to the member state where the CASP operates, meaning a Dutch CASP can only service Dutch users, and a French CASP can only service French users throughout the transitional period. CASPs must have obtained their MiCA license to provide services to users in other EU member states outside their own. A second consideration is the duration of the transition period. MiCA allows for a maximum transition of 18 months up to June 30, 2026. However, member states can shorten the transition, and plenty, including Spain, Italy, and Germany, have already indicated an intention to do so. Therefore, there is plenty of incentive for CASPs to kick off their licensing application as early as possible, to obtain the portability of the MiCA license before the transition period ends. While the transition to a regulated digital asset market necessarily comes with a degree of administrative complexity and overhead, the EU is seeing a proliferation of interest in digital assets that will undoubtedly pay long-term dividends for any short-term pain. Furthermore, the shift to a regulated status means that the future of the industry on EU soil is now a legal certainty, paving the way for further adoption and reinforcing the value of the early mover advantage.
