                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Malaysia but are classified as securities getty Cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender in Malaysia. The Central Bank of Malaysia Act establishes the ringgit as the country's sole legal tender, effectively excluding cryptocurrencies from this status. While the Act doesn't explicitly prohibit cryptocurrencies, it limits the definition of legal tender to the ringgit. However, cryptocurrencies are classified as securities under the Capital Markets and Services Order. This classification gives them a defined legal status within Malaysia's financial regulatory framework. There have been calls from within the government to adopt a more progressive stance towards cryptocurrencies. In March 2022, Zahidi Zainul Abidin, the deputy minister of the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, suggested that Malaysia should adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender. "We hope the government can allow this," Zahidi said in Parliament, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, religious authorities in Malaysia, such as the Shariah Advisory Council of the Securities Commission, have recognized digital currencies as a form of property from an Islamic perspective, further legitimizing their use within the country's predominantly Muslim society, according to a study published in the Journal of Fatwa and Falak Selangor. Regulatory Framework And Key Legislation Bank Negara Malaysia, the country's central bank, is the primary authority overseeing cryptocurrency matters in Malaysia. The key legislative acts governing cryptocurrency regulation: The Central Bank of Malaysia Act: Defines legal tender and BNM's authority over monetary policy. The Financial Services Act: Regulates financial institutions and payment systems, including those related to cryptocurrencies. The Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act: Combats illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. The Capital Markets and Services Order further strengthens the regulatory framework by classifying certain digital currencies and tokens as securities. This brings them under the purview of the Securities Commission Malaysia, imposing additional compliance requirements on cryptocurrency businesses, including obtaining necessary licenses to operate legally. Organizers of unregistered coin offerings may face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million Malaysian ringgit (approximately $2.5 million).

However, infrequent traders may be able to classify their earnings as capital gains, which are not taxable in Malaysia, according to a research in The Journal of Management Theory and Practice. The government has recently stepped up enforcement of these tax regulations Crackdown On Crypto Tax Evasion In June 2024, Malaysia's Inland Revenue Board launched a special operation called "Ops Token" to address tax revenue leakage from cryptocurrency trading. The operation involved raids on 10 locations in the Klang Valley, conducted by 38 personnel from the Royal Malaysia Police and CyberSecurity Malaysia, according to Cointelegraph. The IRB CEO, Datuk Abu Tariq Jamaluddin, warned crypto traders to declare their taxes promptly or face compliance actions. "Through the operation, cryptocurrency trading data stored in mobile devices and computers were found, and we successfully identified the value of digital assets being traded, which caused a very significant leakage of tax revenue," the IRB stated. Crackdown On Illegal Bitcoin Mining While cryptocurrency mining itself is not prohibited in Malaysia, authorities have intensified efforts against illegal operations using stolen electricity. In August 2024, seven individuals were arrested for such activities, as reported by Cointelegraph. The scale of the problem is significant, with the country's deputy energy minister revealing that illegal crypto-mining operations cost an estimated $723 million in stolen electricity between 2018 and 2023. In a display of enforcement, Malaysian authorities used a steamroller to destroy 985 confiscated Bitcoin mining rigs valued at $452,000. This action echoed a similar event in 2021 when $1.25 million worth of mining equipment was destroyed. Challenges And Future Directions Despite Malaysia's efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies, significant challenges remain. According to the study published in the Journal of Fatwa and Falak Selangor, the current regulatory framework lacks comprehensive legislation specifically tailored to digital assets. This gap creates uncertainty for businesses and investors operating in the cryptocurrency space. One key issue, as highlighted in research from the Journal of Management Theory and Practice, is the absence of clear guidelines for consumer protection in cryptocurrency transactions. Unlike traditional financial products, crypto investments lack safeguards against fraud or market manipulation. Additionally, the regulatory framework doesn't adequately address the technological complexities of blockchain and decentralized finance. To improve its regulatory landscape, Malaysia could consider: Developing comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation to provide legal clarity. Implementing stronger consumer protection measures for crypto investors. Establishing a licensing framework for cryptocurrency businesses, similar to Singapore's model. Enhancing collaboration between regulatory bodies to address the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrencies. "Regulations can also vary depending on the state, as different regions may have distinct local laws, especially regarding Islamic finance principles. This regulatory fragmentation can pose challenges for businesses and crypto users, who must navigate both federal guidelines and state-specific rulings," said Andrey Kuznetsov, co-founder and CTO at Haqq Blockchain, in an email statement. Balancing innovation with regulatory compliance will be vital for cryptocurrencies in Malaysia. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.
