                SpaceX CEO Elon Musk believes that the alleged UFOs seen zipping around the United States are not extraterrestrial life but are more likely the US government’s “new weapons programs” that are highly classified.

Musk, 53, revealed that he has “not seen any evidence of aliens” while in charge of his Space Exploration Technologies company during an interview with Tucker Carlson on Monday. 

“There’s a lot we don’t know,” Musk admitted about the existence of humanity and the universe. “Where did we come from? Where are the aliens?”

The billionaire said there are over “6,000 satellites” in orbit and yet have “not once had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.” 

SpaceX has over 6,300 active Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit as of Sept. 2024, according to the non-profit satellite tracker CelesTrak.

Carlson, 55, then asked why there are reports on Earth about the US military having to do “a lot of maneuvering around objects they can’t explain.”

“Well, unidentified flying objects are one thing, but there are always a bunch of classified programs that are underway,” Musk shared. 

The tech mogul claims that the government is likely regularly testing out “new aircraft, new missiles, and things” that are classified at such a high level that even those high up in the chain of command in the US military may not be aware are being tested. 

“Some pilot sees something moving fast and says, ‘Hey, I saw a UFO!'” but it could be a new weapons program that is being experimented on a need-to-know basis. 

Musk, however, “guaranteed” that he would not keep that information from the public if he found any evidence of aliens. 

“The split second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,” he said. “It will probably be our number one post of all time.”

In 2023, Musk said that he hoped the little green men were real and, more importantly, friendly, but he didn’t believe the government was hiding the existence of extraterrestrial beings from the public.

He argued that the government would villainize aliens if it knew of their existence to easily green-light military spending.

While no recent alien sightings by service members were confirmed to be extraterrestrial life in the government report from 2023, Congress is requiring the Pentagon to look into its UFO files dating back to the end of World War II.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence reviewed 366 newly identified military sightings of “unidentified aerial phenomena” – Pentagon jargon for UFOs. 

Of those, 26 were found to be drones, 163 were “balloon or balloon-like entities,” and six were “attributed to clutter” in the air.

Last fall, the Pentagon launched a new portal where current and former service members, government employees, and contractors can report UFO sightings. 

The Pentagon investigated nearly 300 UFO sightings between April 31, 2022, and April 30, 2023.

Some of these flying objects exhibited “concerning performance characteristics,” including high-speed travel and “unusual maneuverability,” according to the report.

However, the report stated that “none of these UAP reports have been positively attributed to foreign activities.”

Last month, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said that Congress will soon receive an update from the Pentagon on UFOs.

Gillibrand, who chairs the United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, said the session is “a priority for me.”

The New York senator wants a “progress report on how many unidentified aerial phenomena we assessed and analyzed.” 

The Department of Defense’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office investigates UFOs and recently appointed Jon Kosloski, a National Security official with a background in quantum optics and crypto-mathematics, to head it.

Gillibrand indicated she expected Kosloski to testify at the hearing, likely after the Nov. 5 election.
