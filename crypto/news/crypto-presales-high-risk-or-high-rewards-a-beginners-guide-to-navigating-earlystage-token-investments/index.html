                The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the latest trend that has been gaining traction in 2024 is crypto pre-sales. These crypto pre-sales have especially become attractive for investors looking for early-stage opportunities. Crypto pre-sales entails tokens being sold before they hit public exchanges, and they both entail great potential on one hand and considerable risks on the other hand. So, for beginners, is it the right move to invest in these pre-sales? Crypto pre-sales explained To understand the opportunities and risks related to this investment opportunity, it is important to first understand the nature of crypto pre-sales. These are also known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and it refers to stages where new cryptocurrencies offer tokens to early investors at a discounted price. This usually can happen before the token is listed on public exchanges. There are several popular cryptocurrencies which started off with highly successful pre-sales, including Ethereum and Tezos, which raised millions and offered early investors substantial returns. Pros of investing in crypto pre-sales: High potentials and access The most attractive aspect of crypto pre-sales is the high potential for returns. Since investors gain access to tokens at a fraction of their future trading price, which can potentially result in high yields. One example of this happening is Ethereum. This currency raised $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and the price during the ICO was $0.311 with over 60 million Ether sold. In other words, it became the one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and has since been a key player in the realm of cryptocurrencies. There are new projects which continue to attract investors since they offer innovative solutions. These include AI-driven trading, decentralized Bitcoin mining, and tokens like BTC Bull Token which are directly linked to Bitcoin, which gives investors a chance to make significant profits if engaging early. The value will rise once the tokens are publicly traded. By offering investors a glimpse into cutting-edge crypto projects, these pre-sales have become a great way to access innovative projects. Pre-sales allow investors to support novel and creative solutions in their earliest stages, as these projects often incorporate emerging technologies and trends. This makes investing in them appealing to any investors who is driven by innovation. Discounted prices and community building Another great pro of investing in crypto pre-sales is the discounted prices these tokens are offered at. In other words, investors can secure these tokens cheaper than they otherwise would cost once they are publicly traded. Several projects have offered tokens in pre-sale for a steep discount, attracting interest from early investors. The benefit of the lower prices means that once the tokens go public and the demand grows, the value also rises, ultimately leading to high returns. Community driven marketing is at the core of pre-sales, which is fostering an ecosystem of community engagement. By engaging investors early, investors become a part of an ecosystem which consists of voting rights, staking rewards, and other perks. Tokens offer benefits and sustainable initiatives to attract an engaged community through entertainment value, which fosters a sense of community around these pre-sales. The downsides of investing in crypto pre-sales One major downside in investing in crypto pre-sales is the high risk of scams and fraud. As the crypto industry is still largely unregulated, scams occur. It is not every pre-sale project that is legitimate, and after raising money some project disappear, which is a phenomenon referred to as a ‘rug pull’. This adds a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of investors to research the team, project, and whitepaper before committing their funds to crypto pre-sale projects. Another downside is the lack of liquidity, as pre-sale investments involve locking up tokens for a set period. This is referred to as a ‘vesting period’ in which the tokens cannot be sold. For some, this lack of liquidity can be a drawback if the market changes, or if the project ends up not performing as well as expected. Another downside is the volatile nature of cryptocurrency, and this also applies to pre-sale tokens. Early access can yield high returns, but they can also plummet in value when the token hits the market, since newly launched tokens experience major price fluctuations as investors profit or the market sentiment shifts. Lastly, there is always uncertainty related to the project outcomes. Since many crypto projects are in their developmental stages when they become available for pre-sales, it also means that there is no guarantee the project will succeed. There is even a risk that the project won’t launch at all. Projects can be derailed, which is a fundamental risk of engaging with crypto pre-sales. Tips for beginners considering crypto pre-sales The first and most important tip for beginners considering crypto pre-sales is to do thorough research. It is important to understand the project, the goals, and the team behind it before investing. What you should look for is a well-written whitepaper, a professional website, and an active community. You should diversify your portfolio by not investing all your funds in one single pre-sale. By spreading out your investment across multiple projects, you are also minimizing your risks. By applying these tips before investing, you can make the most out of the potential benefits of investing in crypto pre-sales.
