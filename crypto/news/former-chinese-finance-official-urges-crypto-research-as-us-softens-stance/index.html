                Cryptocurrencies are “crucial” for the digital economy and China should catch up as the US embraces the industry, according to a former senior Ministry of Finance official, as more experts openly urge the central government to re-evaluate its ban on the virtual assets. Crypto policy in the US has “changed significantly” this year, and China should study its impact and other global policy developments for the sector, Zhu Guangyao, China’s former finance vice-minister, said on Saturday during a panel discussion at an economic forum in Beijing. While cryptocurrencies have risks and could harm the capital market, it is also a “crucial aspect for the development of the entire digital economy”, he added. Zhu, who was second in command at the finance ministry from 2010 to 2018, is among a growing number of Chinese economists calling for Beijing to review its crypto ban on the mainland amid a global expansion in recent years. Beijing first banned initial coin offerings and ordered the closure of crypto exchanges in 2017. It intensified its crackdown in 2021, when it banned bitcoin mining and declared crypto-related business to be illegal. Chinese authorities consider cryptoassets to be a threat to financial stability and a breeding ground for criminal activity. Zhu said the risks from cryptocurrencies – which include impacts on countering terrorist financing and anti-money-laundering efforts, as well as capital market volatility – can be addressed through regulation. “Our current gap [with the US] is that we don’t participate,” Zhu said. “Even with such restrictions, underground trading channels still exist, but you don’t have the ability to utilise it for production because it is prohibited by law.” “Therefore, we need to study new issues, confront them directly, discuss, and resolve them,” he added. Since 2022, Hong Kong has been developing its crypto market, as a separate legal jurisdiction, in an effort to become a global hub for such business with the implicit approval of Beijing. Regulations on the mainland have remained unchanged. While mainland investors have still found ways to trade cryptoassets, there have also been calls for the government to loosen its strict ban as other markets, the US in particular, have taken a more welcoming stance. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in an effort to appeal to cryptocurrency investors, said at a bitcoin conference in July that the US must embrace crypto to avoid letting China “dominate”. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris earlier this month also said that she would encourage “innovative technologies” such as digital assets. Banning crypto mining in China was “very unwise” because it drove business to the US, Wang Yang, vice-president for institutional advancement and chair professor of mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said during a panel discussion in July. If former US president Trump retakes the White House, Wang said, China could be removed from the Swift financial messaging system or at least face restrictions, Wang claimed. The country should also look into tokenisation as a way to prepare for decoupling risks, he added. In late 2022, Chinese economist Huang Yiping, a former member of the monetary policy committee at the People’s Bank of China, also said China should consider whether its cryptocurrency ban was sustainable in the long run, as it could miss opportunities in technologies such as blockchain.
