                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 16: Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen during the ... [+] Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Informal Dialogue with Guests during APEC Leaders' Week at Moscone Center on November, 16, 2023 in San Francisco, California. The APEC Summit takes place through November 17. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Getty Images China's economic growth is slowing significantly. This year, it may fail to achieve what was already a low 5% annual growth rate goal. Beyond representing a significant economic change, this will have many implications for Bitcoin. It may well represent a hidden bullish factor as Bitcoin prices continue to test upward momentum after a couple of months of stagnation—a theme I often explore in my book on Bitcoin + China. 1- China's investors are looking for an exit from stagnating Chinese assets Asset bubbles are being created in China, which has been responsible for the stark increase in gold prices. Since Chinese equities and real estate are down, there's a premium for exiting money from the Chinese system and getting a return elsewhere. Chinese investors have piled onto gold ETFs and government bonds. In 2022, Chinese savers were estimated to sock away over $2.6 trillion in the domestic Chinese banking sector. However, that behavior may change with interest rates now ticking down and more stimulus being put on the table. A persistently high Chinese savings rate unique among other nations may need a new place to go: with historic interest in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies, Chinese investors looking for an exit ramp may just choose Bitcoin's allure - a path towards getting money out of the Chinese system and being able to transact with financial freedom. With an exchange ban in the Mainland, over-the-trading counters are one way for Chinese people to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. While some Chinese crypto buyers use exchanges with different addresses, many large buyers would prefer to work with OTC desks. Those OTC desks have recently seen record inflows since 2021, showing a rebound from when China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining and trading. This recent surge in price-boosting demand seems motivated mainly by the declining return on Chinese assets. 2- China's central bank is piling more onto the stimulus fire in response China's economic downturn has created pressure on both monetary and fiscal authorities to turn the economy around. The most alarming statistic is the high unemployment rate for youth. The central bank is decreasing interest rate targeting and loosening the money supply in China, which will help in the short term with Bitcoin's correlation with risk assets as central banks race with one another to fight growing downturns in the economy around the world. Already, Chinese investors are racing back from bonds to Chinese equities - risk assets more correlated with Bitcoin's price. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is also lowering rates and expanding US monetary supply, which will allow the Chinese central bank to also lower rates to keep the Yuan at the same preferred trading range as now and not to worry about a weakening Yuan against the US dollar (in fact, both may just weaken against Bitcoin.) 3- Chinese businesses are still a large part of Bitcoin's network In the case of Bitcoin mining, it's estimated that about 20% of the global hash rate still resides in China despite increasing amounts of restrictions and province-level bans as of 2022. As local governments in China struggle to raise tax revenue because of declining land value, the prospect of working with companies that can leverage stranded power into tax revenue and economic growth becomes much more attractive - and may account for the surprising amount of global hash rate securing the Bitcoin network remaining in China despite the level of restrictions and bans.

Though tariffs have hit them on the American side and restrictions on the Chinese side, and now they manufacture mostly outside of China, they still maintain many offices in China. Many mining pools offering software that coordinates Bitcoin mining originated from China, and exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX did, too. As an economic downturn with few state-guided technological windfalls unwinds, the entrepreneurial energy dedicated to starting Bitcoin's momentum in China may now be directed towards Bitcoin again, along with increases in buying activity. Chinese entrepreneurs, businesses, and buyers will once again have the opportunity to contribute their efforts to Bitcoin - as I've written at length about in my book on Bitcoin + China. China's loss, in this case, may well be Bitcoin's gain. Check out my website. Roger Huang Following Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades
