                The crypto market is humming following BlackRock, the biggest asset management worldwide, allegedly advising clients to allocate 85% of their portfolios to Bitcoin (BTC). With this audacious action, the value of Bitcoin has surged; other cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin (DOGE), lags behind. Meanwhile, Intel Markets (INTL) is attracting interest as investors swarm to BTC with its AI-driven trading tools, meant to let traders optimize possibilities across crypto assets, thereby placing itself as a major participant in this changing market environment. BlackRock’s bold Bitcoin (BTC) bet: Why 85% allocation signals a bullish breakout The fact that BlackRock has put Bitcoin’s (BTC) long-term potential at 85% on their recommendation shows how confident they are in it. The asset management argues that the large allocation is justified by the cryptocurrency’s stability, expanding utility as a store of value, and growing institutional interest. In addition, when the economy is in a state of flux, Bitcoin’s decentralized characteristics and dominant market position make it a tempting inflation and conventional market risk hedge. After breaking out from the $52,500 support level earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin has been rising consistently. The 200-day moving average is a significant barrier close to $64,000, although it has subsequently recovered the $57,000 and $60,000 levels. Bitcoin (BTC) may reach new record highs in the next weeks if positive sentiment persists and the price breaks out above this level. As the price of bitcoin has been consolidating recently, the 30-day moving average of the funds leaving the market indicates that miners have drastically cut down on selling. The decrease in supply in the market is likely caused by miners hoarding Bitcoin (BTC) in the hopes of its price going up. Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to break resistance as Whales accumulate amidst market recovery Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to lag behind despite the broader crypto market’s recovery, struggling to break out of its horizontal resistance at $0.11. Over the past month, the meme coin has faced selling pressure each time it attempted to rally, making three failed attempts to push above the resistance line. This ongoing challenge highlights Dogecoin’s inability to maintain momentum and capitalize on market improvements. A key factor behind Dogecoin’s stagnation is the balance between buying and selling pressures within its trading channel since August 4. While Dogecoin (DOGE) whales have significantly increased their accumulation, with large holders’ netflow surging by 179%, the price remains range-bound. The support at $0.09 holds firm, but the repeated failures to break through resistance suggest that sellers still dominate the market at critical levels. Currently, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) weighted sentiment sits at a negative -0.63, reflecting pessimism that has persisted since mid September. Intel Markets (INTL): Revolutionizing trading with 1000x leverage and AI powered Blockchain solutions Intel Markets (INTL) has recently dazzled the trading community by providing highly advanced trading tools to traders. They allow traders to achieve as much as 1000x capital leverage in the market.
