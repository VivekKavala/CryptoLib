                    The Smartest Crypto ETF to Buy With $50 Right Now
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Each day, more and more people start investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). It's not hard to understand why. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has risen roughly 278% in value. Bitcoin's value, meanwhile, has soared by more than 17,000% over the same time period.

If you want to add huge growth potential to your portfolio by betting on crypto, there's only one ETF that most investors need.

There's a reason why Bitcoin is so famous

When talking about Bitcoin six years ago, legendary investor Peter Thiel summarized the investment pitch for the cryptocurrency: "Money is the bubble that never pops." Consider the U.S. dollar. It holds value because everyone believes that it holds value. There are some backstop forms of value such as military might and the power of taxation. But in general, currencies like the U.S. dollar -- or even stores of value like gold -- have value because we all agree that they have value.

When it comes to investing, the rule is typically to find opportunities that will create hard value in the form of distributable cash flows or real world profits. Betting on what other people think the stock will be worth can be a dicey game. That's why most experts build complex models and analyze financials to determine whether the price they are paying for an investment will be worth the eventual reward.

Currency -- or more colloquially, "money" -- is the exception to this rule. Dollar bills don't produce more dollar bills. That's not where their value stems from. Their value, on a core level, is as a social instrument. We all agree that it represents the value of whatever work was put into earning it. Bitcoin operates in very much the same way. It's considered a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, meaning miners are continually working -- in this case, they're solving complex mathematical problems -- to produce more Bitcoins. And while it doesn't have much direct functionality besides as a form of money, it's the first time a form of money has been created that doesn't involve major nation states or other centralized powers.

Of course, a bunch of other things are happening in the crypto universe as well. And it's possible that crypto in general enters our daily life in ways we never expected, just as the internet continues to do. But regardless of whether those ventures are successful, Bitcoin will always "work." That is, it will always retain its ability to act as a form of money and a store of value.

This is the only crypto ETF you need

Due to these factors, most everyday investors only need one ETF to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies: the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT).

As its name suggests, this ETF tracks the price performance of Bitcoin, without requiring investors to bother with the complex custodial issues related to buying Bitcoin directly. The fund currently has an expense ratio of just 0.12% -- even lower than most actively traded funds. And because the fund only tracks the performance of Bitcoin, you don't have to worry about betting on a fast-changing ecosystem of crypto-related start-ups whose future is anybody's guess right now. Decades from now, Bitcoin will likely still exist, while the long list of crypto ventures started in recent years may be a thing of the past.

The best part of investing in a crypto ETF like this is that it makes dollar-cost averaging easy. If you buy $50 per month of this ETF, for example, you make sure to continually invest throughout Bitcoin's somewhat volatile trading ranges. That way, you don't need to worry about timing the market, as you're making sure to buy when prices are high and when prices are low -- a wise investing strategy that's a bit more difficult when buying Bitcoin directly.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,121!*Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,917!*Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $370,844!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

                            Ripple (XRP) is getting a lot of attention from investors looking to grow their money. At the same time, Fantom (FTM) is struggling, which is making many people think twice about their investments.

Ripple (XRP) Continues to Attract Big Investors

Recently, Ripple (XRP) has caught the eye of big investors. Reports say its price is around $0.5, which is a nice increase. People are excited because its market cap is likely over $30 billion, showing strong interest in this cryptocurrency.

Experts also mention that the trading volume is impressive. Some estimate it has reached about $1.4 billion in the last 24 hours. This means many traders buy and sell Ripple (XRP), increasing its popularity. Investors see this as a good sign for Ripple’s (XRP) future.

Furthermore, many believe that this success is just starting. With a solid supply of coins and room for growth, investors feel hopeful. They see Ripple (XRP) as an intelligent choice in the changing crypto world. As more people learn about XRP, it might attract even more interest in the days ahead.

Fantom (FTM) Losing Its Spark as Buyers Look Elsewhere

Fantom (FTM) is losing its shine in the crypto market. Reports show its price is around $0.7, reflecting a slight drop. With a market cap likely near $2 billion, some investors question whether excitement for Fantom is fading.

Moreover, the trading volume is low, estimated at $189 million over the past 24 hours. This decline indicates fewer buyers are interested in Fantom (FTM), prompting some to look for better options. The general sentiment seems less hopeful than before.

Experts still see potential in Fantom (FTM), but buyer confidence needs to be regained. With a circulating supply of around 2.8 billion Fantom (FTM), many hope it can spark renewed interest. As the market changes, attracting new investors will be necessary to make Fantom (FTM) relevant.

                    Crypto's $130 million congressional election binge has candidates like Utah's John Curtis poised for big wins
                </h3>

                            The Republican candidates in Indiana and West Virginia have each received more than $3 million from Defend American Jobs. In Massachusetts, a super PAC for Republican John Deaton has pulled in $2.6 million from the crypto industry. Deaton, however, is polling way behind Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is one of the crypto sector's top antagonists in Washington.

"Elizabeth Warren is not going to lose her election in Massachusetts, so the industry can't get rid of Warren," said Delmore. "But they can at least help to vote out candidates who are allied with her against the crypto industry."

One big target is Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, the chair of the banking committee. Some $40 million of crypto money has been directed at defeating Brown, and one PAC has paid for five ads designed to boost awareness of his Republican rival, Bernie Moreno, a blockchain entrepreneur. The race is currently very close and is crucial in determining which party will control the Senate.

In House races, around $3.6 million in crypto PAC money has gone to candidates in Arizona, $5.4 million in New York, more than $4.8 million in Virginia, and $5.7 million in California, with half of that spend going to Republican Michelle Park Steel.

Crypto PAC money has been party agnostic and not just focused on battleground districts. The focus is on supporting lawmakers who embrace regulation that favors the technology rather than getting in its way.

"When we talk about digital assets, when we talk about crypto, that is not about Republicans and Democrats," said House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), at Permissionless. "That's about Americans, that's about decentralization of a system that has been, literally, consolidated at the top."

                    Best Cryptos Analysts Recommend for Maximum Profits in Q4 2024
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            As we enter the fourth quarter of 2024, smart investors are beginning to bet on cryptocurrencies with high profit potential. The altcoins making the rounds are Litecoin (LTC), which could soon get an ETF; Uniswap (UNI), which just launched its own chain; and DTX Exchange (DTX), the presale gem that has raised over $5 million.

Coincodex predicts the price of Litecoin (LTC) could soar to $90.06. Also, analysts say Uniswap’s value could pump to $17.55. Meanwhile, the cost of DTX Exchange is expected to pump by 1,000% this fourth quarter.

Litecoin (LTC) Price Skyrockets As Canary Capital Applies for LTC ETF

Asset manager Canary Capital announced Tuesday that it had submitted an S-1 registration for a Litecoin (LTC) spot ETF with the US SEC. If passed, the ETF will offer retail and institutional investors direct access to the Litecoin token.

The value of the cryptocurrency has increased following the news. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Litecoin price has surged by 8.9% on the weekly chart and 11.4% on the monthly timeframe.

Regarding price movement, the Litecoin crypto trades close to the 200-SMA ($72.59). Coincodex forecasts the altcoin price could surge to $90.06 by November. Analysts like B_Oltman have given a higher price target, suggesting that LTC could peak at $150 this year.

Uniswap (UNI) Active Addresses Increase By 16x

In a recent tweet on X, a crypto enthusiast quoting data from Token Terminal revealed that the number of active addresses on the Uniswap network has skyrocketed to 20 million in October. This figure is an increase of 16x in the last year and shows that more users are joining Uniswap (UNI).

This increase comes a week after the Uniswap (UNI) team introduced Unichain, its Layer-2 solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. This new chain is aimed at addressing some of the scalability problems of Interoperability in the DeFi market and increasing the transaction throughput for Ethereum’s Main chain.

Following the news, the price of the Uniswap coin has recorded some gains on the weekly and monthly charts on CoinMarketCap. It currently consolidates between the 50-SMA ($6.96) and 200-SMA ($8.57). Experts forecast that the new development could attract more activity to Uniswap (UNI), so they forecast that the Uniswap price might jump to $17.55 this fourth quarter.

DTX Exchange (DTX), Investors Best Bet For Price Gains

DTX Exchange (DTX) is gaining attention as one of the new ICOs with the potential for growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. Investors are rallying around this cryptocurrency after it increased by 300% quickly to reach its current price of $0.08. The goal of the DTX is to build a hybrid exchange that Integrates the strengths of the centralized exchange (CEX) and decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms into one.

Over 120k asset classes are available, including FX, bonds indices, cryptocurrencies, commodities, etc. Users can trade without any KYC or identification and remain anonymous. This is a significant advantage for users who prefer to keep their identity private while they seek to trade several different financial instruments on one trading site. DTX offers crypto traders access to over 120,000 assets from the $714.7 trillion OTC derivatives market.

Also, DTX Exchange provides traders with sophisticated charts, graphs, and analysis tools to be aware of market shifts.

The Best Cryptos To Buy in Q4: Litecoin, Uniswap, or DTX

If there’s one thing that has been more or less confirmed, it is that the value of Litecoin (LTC), Uniswap (UNI), and the DTX Exchange (DTX) tokens could soar in the coming weeks. While those above are the top crypto coins poised for massive increases, DTX is a better investment opportunity for everyone willing to make a profitable year-end investment.

                    Fake trading apps on Google Play and App Store linked to global ‘pig butchering’ scam
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Pig butchering is a form of investment fraud where scammers persuade their victims into making large investments on fake trading platforms. The scheme—which is commonly associated with cryptocurrency and is surprisingly vegan-friendly—refers to how scammers build trust with their victims before later draining them of their investments. The ruse has proven to be a lucrative cyber threat, with researchers from the University of Texas at Austin estimating that pig butchering scammers have stolen more than $75 billion from victims in the last four years.

Since May, Group-IB analysts have identified several fake mobile applications that have been disguised as trading platforms on the Google Play and Apple App Store, and used as part of the global scheme. The cybersecurity company, which was founded in Russia but shifted its headquarters to Singapore in 2019, has classified the fraudulent apps as members of the UniShadowTrade malware family and said the mobile applications were built using the UniApp Framework.

Hoodwinked! While Group-IB was unable to pinpoint how cybercriminals are going about targeting their pig butchering victims, the report suggested it is most likely through social engineering tactics on dating and social networking platforms. After building a relationship with their victims, malicious actors are then able to convince them to download seemingly legit applications to execute their crime.

One example of a fake app discovered by Group-IB deceived users with a description that claimed it could be used for “algebraic mathematical formulas and 3D graphics volume area calculations.” Users who downloaded the app were prompted to make an account and disclose sensitive information, before being instructed to make a deposit. The cybercriminal is then able to convince the victim to continue investing money on the platform, which they are unable to withdraw.

The app has since been removed from the App Store, but Group-IB claims that cybercriminals have continued to circulate it to both Apple and Android users through phishing websites.

Another bogus app discovered by Group-IB on the Google Play Store masqueraded as an application that shared stock-related news. The app racked up more than a thousand downloads before being removed by the app store.

Group-IB claims it was able to identify pig butchering victims across the Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle East and Africa regions.

Zoom out. The recently discovered tactic joins the slew of strategies malicious actors are using to perform investment-related crimes. IT Brew has previously reported that cybercriminals are also sending their victims to their local Bitcoin ATM to secretly drain their accounts and impersonating the web pages of common retail brands as part of their crypto fraud gambits.

                    BlackRock’s ETF chief says 75% of its bitcoin buyers are crypto fans new to Wall Street
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            SALT LAKE CITY — A year ago, Samara Cohen believed there was so much pent-up demand for bitcoin that she and her team at BlackRock launched one of the first-ever spot bitcoin exchange-traded products in the U.S. Now investors are flocking in, and a lot of them are crypto enthusiasts who are new to Wall Street.

Cohen, who heads up the asset manager’s exchange-traded funds and index investments as chief investment officer, told CNBC that BlackRock now sees the demand was for a better way to access bitcoin. “It was for the ETF wrapper,” she told CNBC on stage at the Permissionless Conference in Utah.

The total market cap of all eleven spot bitcoin ETFs now tops $63 billion, with total flows of nearly $20 billion. In the last five trading days alone, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of more than $2.1 billion, with BlackRock accounting for half of those sales.

The spike in trading volume comes as bitcoin hit its highest level since July this week, trading above $68,300. Bitcoin ended the third quarter up around 140% from the same quarter a year ago, outpacing the S&P 500, as these spot token funds and the crypto market cap move higher in lock-step. Crypto-aligned stock Coinbase closed up about 24% this week, its best week since February.

Cohen told CNBC that part of the strategy for attracting customers to its funds was teaching crypto investors about the benefits of exchange-traded products (ETPs).

13F filings, which offer quarterly reads on equity positions taken by large investors, show that 80% of the buyers of these new spot bitcoin products in the U.S. are direct investors. Of the 80% of direct investors, Cohen told CNBC that 75% had never before owned an iShare, one of the best-known and largest ETF providers on the planet.

“So we went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically,” said Cohen. “As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper.”

Before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission green-lit spot bitcoin funds in January, investors had a few ways to buy and custody cryptocurrencies. A centralized exchange like Coinbase was among the most user-friendly options for U.S investors. But the blockbuster debut of bitcoin ETPs has laid bare to Cohen and others across Wall Street, that crypto exchanges weren’t giving digital asset investors everything they needed.

                    Bitcoin Surges as Trump’s Election Odds Improve
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Bitcoin’s recent price surge has caught investors’ attention, partly due to its potential link to Donald Trump’s improving chances in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

The digital asset has risen by about 13% in the past week, outpacing global stock indicators and gold. Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller pointed to crypto as one of the signs that markets are pricing in a Trump victory.

Trump has pledged to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if he wins the tight race against his Democratic rival. His opponent in the election is Vice President Kamala Harris.

The cryptocurrency’s advance coincided with shifts in prediction markets, where people can bet on election outcomes. On the Polymarket platform, Trump‘s odds have increased to 60%, while Harris’s have decreased to 40%.

PredictIt shows Trump’s chances at 54%, compared to Harris’s 50%. Arisa Toyosaki, co-founder of crypto derivatives provider Cega, noted that enthusiasm in prediction markets is causing high levels of implied volatility.

She also mentioned that this has led to a rally in Bitcoin spot prices. Net inflows into a group of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $285 million ($1.6 billion) since October 11.

Price Surges Amid Political Shifts

Bitcoin traded around $67,300 on Thursday in London, compared to its March record of $73,798. Though prediction markets favor Trump, most polls show a margin-of-error difference with less than three weeks until Election Day.

Harris has taken a nuanced stance on cryptocurrencies, promising to support a regulatory framework for digital assets and sector growth with proper safeguards.

Her position has sparked optimism among crypto traders, as it contrasts with the Biden Administration’s crackdown.

Meltem Demirors, general partner at Crucible Capital, told Bloomberg Television that crypto’s emergence as an election issue is directing attention to bitcoin.

She added that it is also drawing focus to crypto assets in general. This attention translates into sentiment, which drives flows.

Trump’s support for the sector marks a shift from his previous stance, where he once called it a scam. Digital asset firms have become influential players in elections through large donations to political action committees seeking friendlier rules.

Druckenmiller stated in a Bloomberg Television interview that the market over the last 12 days seemed “very convinced” of a Trump victory, visible in bank stocks and crypto performance.

As the election approaches, the connection between Bitcoin’s price and political developments continues to intrigue investors and analysts alike.

                    US SEC gives green light for options listing for spot bitcoin ETFs to NYSE

                            The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to 11 exchange-traded funds to list and trade options tied to spot bitcoin prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a regulatory filing. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry.

Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are among funds that received the approval on Friday. 

The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. 

Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. 

The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock's, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

                    “Sam Altman Introduces a New Orb and Renames his Eye-Scanning Crypto Project”
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            The cryptocurrency and human identity network known as Worldcoin, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has rebranded to World. With this change, World has unveiled an updated version of its eyeball-scanning Orb device, aimed at addressing the futuristic challenge of verifying human identity in the era of artificial intelligence.

Users who join the platform receive a World ID, allowing them to demonstrate their humanity securely and anonymously online, as well as receive a portion of the associated WLD cryptocurrency.

The latest Orb model features a 30% reduction in components compared to its predecessor, promising simplified and cost-effective manufacturing. Additionally, it now incorporates Nvidia’s robotics and AI platform, Jetson, a decision not entirely explained. Rich Heley, Chief Device Officer of Tools for Humanity, the organization supporting the World project, highlighted that this streamlined design is intended to facilitate broader access to the Orb.

“To provide access to every human, we need more Orbs. Lots more Orbs. Probably on the order of a thousand times more Orbs than we have today,” Heley said. “Not only more Orbs but more Orbs in more places.” In addition to ramping up production of the Orb, World will even let people purchase or rent their very own eyeball-scanning sphere so they can “start verifying unique humans” in their communities.

It’s also launching a new service called “Orb on Demand” (yes, it’s really called that) that will let people order Orbs “much like a pizza you would have delivered to your apartment,” Heley said. The Orb is also coming to more countries, including Costa Rica, Brazil, Indonesia, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and others.

World says it has verified nearly 7 million “unique humans” so far, despite privacy concerns about building a privately operated global database based on biometrics.

                    BlackRock's ETF chief says 75% of its bitcoin buyers are crypto fans new to Wall Street
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            SALT LAKE CITY — A year ago, Samara Cohen believed there was so much pent-up demand for bitcoin that she and her team at BlackRock launched one of the first-ever spot bitcoin exchange-traded products in the U.S. Now investors are flocking in, and a lot of them are crypto enthusiasts who are new to Wall Street.

Cohen, who heads up the asset manager's exchange-traded funds and index investments as chief investment officer, told CNBC that BlackRock now sees the demand was for a better way to access bitcoin. "It was for the ETF wrapper," she told CNBC on stage at the Permissionless Conference in Utah.

The total market cap of all eleven spot bitcoin ETFs now tops $63 billion, with total flows of nearly $20 billion. In the last five trading days alone, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of more than $2.1 billion, with BlackRock accounting for half of those sales.

The spike in trading volume comes as bitcoin hit its highest level since July this week, trading above $68,300. Bitcoin ended the third quarter up around 140% from the same quarter a year ago, outpacing the S&P 500, as these spot token funds and the crypto market cap move higher in lock-step. Crypto-aligned stock Coinbase closed up about 24% this week, its best week since February.

Cohen told CNBC that part of the strategy for attracting customers to its funds was teaching crypto investors about the benefits of exchange-traded products (ETPs).

13F filings, which offer quarterly reads on equity positions taken by large investors, show that 80% of the buyers of these new spot bitcoin products in the U.S. are direct investors. Of the 80% of direct investors, Cohen told CNBC that 75% had never before owned an iShare, one of the best-known and largest ETF providers on the planet.

"So we went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," said Cohen. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper."

Before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission green-lit spot bitcoin funds in January, investors had a few ways to buy and custody cryptocurrencies. A centralized exchange like Coinbase was among the most user-friendly options for U.S investors. But the blockbuster debut of bitcoin ETPs has laid bare to Cohen and others across Wall Street, that crypto exchanges weren't giving digital asset investors everything they needed.

                    Sam Altman’s eyeball-scanning crypto project has a new Orb and a new name

                            Worldcoin, the cryptocurrency / human identity network / UBI project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is now known as World. Along with the name change, World introduced an updated version of its eyeball-scanning Orb device which is designed to solve a problem that does not currently exist: authenticating that someone is human “in the age of AI.” 

People registered to the system get a World ID that they can use to “securely and anonymously” prove their humanness online, as well as a share of its associated WLD cryptocurrency token.

The new Orb is made with 30 percent fewer parts than its predecessor, which is supposed to make it easier and cheaper to build, and equipped with Nvidia’s robotics and AI platform, Jetson, for some reason. Rich Heley, the chief device officer of Tools for Humanity — the foundation behind the World project — said during an event on Thursday that the simplified design should help achieve the goal of making the Orb widely available.

“To provide access to every human, we need more Orbs. Lots more Orbs. Probably on the order of a thousand times more Orbs than we have today,” Heley said. “Not only more Orbs but more Orbs in more places.” In addition to ramping up production of the Orb, World will even let people purchase or rent their very own eyeball-scanning sphere so they can “start verifying unique humans” in their communities.

It’s also launching a new service called “Orb on Demand” (yes, it’s really called that) that will let people order Orbs “much like a pizza you would have delivered to your apartment,” Heley said. The Orb is also coming to more countries, including Costa Rica, Brazil, Indonesia, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and others.

While World’s ID services are available in the US, its cryptocurrency token isn’t, as our own Alex Heath noted when he was scanned last summer.

World says it has verified nearly 7 million “unique humans” so far, despite privacy concerns about building a privately operated global database based on biometrics.

Last year, Kenya suspended World while it investigated its practices surrounding data collection (it has since dropped its investigation). Hong Kong asked World to stop all operations in the country over privacy risks, while both Portugal and Spain have also taken action against the project.

                    Trading crypto pairs: global broker Octa’s guide
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – Media OutReach Newswire – 18 October 2024 – These days, many traders in Southeast Asia look for cryptocurrencies as a high-value opportunity to diversify their portfolio. While some buy and sell crypto directly via dedicated crypto exchanges, others prefer trading contracts for difference (CFDs) on cryptocurrencies with Forex brokers. The latter approach allows traders to bypass all transactional and security difficulties associated with owning digital assets while tapping into crypto’s volatility and profit potential. 

 The difference between brokers and crypto exchanges Crypto exchanges and brokerages operate differently in the trading landscape. The exchanges act as matchmakers and facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers to and from crypto and fiat currencies. 

 On the other hand, brokerages directly engage with clients and offer them guaranteed trade fulfilment and higher liquidity. They provide a broader range of financial instruments for trading, including contracts for differences on cryptocurrencies, fiat currency pairs, indices, and more. 

 When trading via a cryptocurrency exchange, the buyer becomes the owner of the digital asset once the trade is complete and stores it using an e-wallet. Conversely, trading USD/cryptocurrency pairs with a broker doesn’t involve the physical ownership of digital assets. Instead, traders deal with derivatives, such as CFDs, and speculate on the price movement of a cryptocurrency against the USD without owning the cryptocurrency itself. 

 The choice of a platform Forex brokers often offer much higher leverage options than crypto exchanges, creating ample opportunity for profits. However, these opportunities come with a higher risk, meaning financial knowledge acquisition and continuous learning become even more critical as the primary source of progress towards financial goals. 

 Brokers also offer traders a larger pool of order options, including limit orders, stop-loss and take-profit orders, and more. This extensive arsenal helps traders use market fluctuations to their advantage and fine-tune their charts according to their preferences. 

 For those interested in profiting from the dynamically evolving crypto trading landscape, Octa, a global broker with extensive market experience, offers 34 CFDs on popular cryptocurrencies. This portfolio of digital assets allows traders to tap into crypto’s potential without burdening themselves with e-wallets and other dedicated tools that can compromise the security of their funds and personal data. 

 While many inexperienced traders start trading crypto on dedicated exchanges, opting for a broker with a more comprehensive range of assets may provide some advantages. In particular, brokers can offer a seamless and more secure experience within a single trading platform, higher leverage, and more portfolio diversification options. Hashtag: #Octa

                    Tesla's $750 Million in Bitcoin Just Vanished From Where It Was Being Stored
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">

                            Disappearing Act

In case you've forgotten, Elon Musk's Tesla is among the largest bitcoin whales in the world.

So when all of a sudden its over $760 million worth of the cryptocurrency seemingly vanished from its digital vault earlier this week, it stoked a bit of a panic.

The automaker's hoard of bitcoin hasn't been touched in two years. But now, every single one of the digital tokens has been moved to unknown wallets, Coindesk reports, raising fears in the crypto scene that Musk plans to sell off its decentralized assets.

Since Musk is himself an influential figure in the space, such a massive sell-off could spark a wave of others dumping their coins, too, potentially causing its price to crash. It's unclear, however, what Tesla or Musk's intentions are with the transfer.

Crypto Connoisseur

You may well be aware of Musk's enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies — especially Dogecoin, a memecoin that he has consistently peddled online. Anything he says on the topic can carry enough weight to singlehandedly send prices soaring (or in some cases, plunging).

In 2021, under his stewardship, Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. When the sale was revealed, it catalyzed another wave of hype for the digital assets.

Pretty much everything after that has been more tepid. Months after the huge buy-in, Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for car payments, citing environmental concerns around crypto mining and transactions.

The biggest blow came the following summer, in 2022. Amid a downturn in bitcoin's valuation, Tesla offloaded a whopping 75 percent of its bitcoin holdings — at a huge loss of some $200 million.

Perhaps prudently, the automaker hasn't touched any of its precious coins since — until this week, that is — which are currently selling at historically high prices.

Mystery Moves

Nevertheless, what Musk and Tesla are preparing for by moving around its crypto stash is, at this point, merely speculation.

There are no clear signs that they intend to sell, such as a transfer to a crypto exchange platform like Coinbase, as Coindesk notes.

Still, for those with skin in the game, Musk's silence on the money move must be disquieting.

I like charts simple. If you put enough lines on a chart you can make a case for anything, so the simpler, the more emphatic, the better.

Here is the bitcoin (BTC) chart:

The bitcoin chart - a textbook breakout

This is mouth-watering for anyone that looks at charts in the hope of seeing the future. It’s a textbook breakout. A breakout means a big move up for bitcoin and with holders awaiting the fabled move above $100,000, a real breakout is a very big deal.

So here is a way of looking at this configuration:

The bitcoin chart shows a reversal of the trend

Let me translate. The long-term trend has been bearish with the cycles showing bearish sub-trends. The latest cycle, however, has been bullish because it is sliding up in a bullish tendency.

You can forget all that though, because the price has broken up through the ceiling of the long-term trend and that classically means we are going to reprice a lot higher. I could draw a lot of lines saying where this could go but that’s secondary to it actually kicking off a breakout where pretty much anything that happens next is going to be good news. Of course I’ll do that in another piece, but let’s keep it simple. The simplest question is markets and the most important is, is the asset going up or down, and this is the only call worth making for bitcoin right now and the charts says “Yes.”

This is 101 technical analysis. But wait! It’s very early days if this is the breakout we have all been waiting for and nipping a tiny amount above a trend ceiling is not a guarantee. This is the “Get Ready” and if you are aggressive “Get Set” moment before the pistol “Go!”

Bitcoin Facing A Trump Ramp Or A Harris Dump

A high chance that the next leg up has started is in place, and these probabilities will rise if this move continues upwards on the same trajectory. Trading and investing is a game of balancing risk with rewards and as uncertainty diminishes so the risk/reward relationship shifts hopefully in your favor.

I covered this set up a few days ago when we were approaching a “Get Set” situation but the recent moves have lifted the odds of a real break out to a point where it’s time to get focused on what you are going to do if we do head to new levels. You can read what I said here.

I think if we do break up further, especially and if we clear the all-time recent high, we will get a significant move which of course suggests $100,000 and more.

While the catalyst might not be apparent until later, the outcome is going to crystalize imminently. A reversion to the trend is always way more likely that a proper breakout, but the current configuration is about as promising as they come.

I only hold crypto at present because of the potential of another leg up so to me and to many others, staking out bitcoin for the next move up is what holding is all about.

To finish, take a look at MicroStrategy (MSTR). Do the investors who are pushing this know something about bitcoin we don’t?

Now there is a really emphatic breakout.

                    Four mystery accounts dished out $30 million of crypto on bets that Trump will win White House
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Four mysterious accounts have reportedly bet $30 million on Trump to win the presidency in November. 

Bettors on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, have increased their wagers that the Republican nominee would win the election in recent weeks. 

While National polling averages by FiveThirtyEight show Harris with a 2.5-point lead over Trump, on Friday, Trump had 60 per cent betting odds on Polymarket compared to Harris’ 39 per cent.

The online market showed odds for the political opponents as neck-and-neck until October 7, when the former president started making significant gains.

The flood of support for Trump, the Wall Street Journal first reported, could be attributed to four Polymarket accounts — Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro and Michie. Together, these accounts reportedly bet tens of millions in cryptocurrency on Trump.

“There’s strong reason to believe they are the same entity,” Miguel Morel, who founded Arkham Intelligence, a firm that analyzes blockchain and crypto activity, told the outlet.

Arkham found that these four accounts were all funded by deposits from US crypto exchange Kraken.

Each of these accounts operate similarly, like increasing the size of their bets at the same time and betting on Trump winning swing states as well as the general election, according to Arkham.

Polymarket is investigating presidential-election market activity, a source familiar with the matter told the Journal. The Independent has reached out to Polymarket for comment.

Some online are warning that Trump could point to the Polymarket odds to argue the election was ‘rigged’ if he loses.

Crypto investor Adam Cochran expressed a similar sentiment to the Journal, warning that the uptick in favorable odds for Trump could create a perception of pro-Trump momentum that is inconsistent with the polls. “It is by far the most efficient political advertising one can buy,” Cochran told the outlet.

The betting spree also came one day after Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder and vocal Trump supporter, noted Trump’s slight lead on the Polymarket in a post on X: “Trump now leading Kamala by 3% in betting markets. More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.” 

It’s unclear if Musk’s post, which has been viewed 87 million times, has translated to bets on the prediction market.

Losing access to funds can be a shock for customers of financial technology firms.

The news media has extensively covered the crash and burn trajectories of some of the leading crypto companies since FTX led the way into bankruptcy in November 2022. Soon to follow were BlockFi, Celsuis, Voyager, and many others that were not as high profile. Crypto companies were highly criticized, and in some instances deservedly so, but what about the failures on financial technology firms providing traditional products? Customers are at much higher risk from the non-crypto providers because in many cases the customers do not recognize the risks and underestimate the consequences of failure.

Financial technology (fintech) companies that provide banking-like products are a hidden risk to customers, and for the most part, customers appear oblivious to the risks they assume when using the services of such firms.

By way of example, a wave of fintech providers either ceased operating or experienced substantial disruption in April 2024 when a behind-the-scenes provider of services to these fintech companies, Synapse Financial Technologies, declared bankruptcy. Copper, Mainvest, Yotta, Juno, YieldStreet, and many more firms were impacted.

Similar non-bank fintech firms such as Mercury, Brex, Fold, Wise and many more provide banking-like services to customers, and as they grow so does the potential impact to customers in case of a failure.

In the case of FTX and some of the other crypto-related bankruptcies, almost two years after the firms ceased operating, only now are customers beginning to expect to receive return of some of their funds. In larger bankruptcy cases it is not uncommon for the process to take years, and for customers to only receive repayment of a fraction of their funds.

Customers of some of the fintech firms impacted by the collapse of Synapse were shocked to discover that they could not access their funds. It has been almost six months so far, and for some customers there is not even a timeline about when they can access their funds. It is even unclear how much of their funds will be returned. Jason Mikula has reported extensively on the aftermath in FinTech Business Weekly.

As customers have repeatedly explained to the court in the Synapse bankruptcy hearings, customers believed, or even perhaps were led to believe, that their deposits were insured in case of failure. That was not accurate.

Cryptocurrency Firm Failures

Cryptocurrency, and bitcoin in particular, is a new and exciting asset class that providers investors with risks and rewards that may not be correlated with other assets.

History teaches that in anything new that promises high potential rewards some of the earliest promoters may also be those with the loosest grasp of ethical and lawful behavior. In America we can look back to the swindles associated with land in the gold rush or the shenanigans around stock promotion in the early part of the twentieth century. The Securities Act of 1933 and The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were enacted to curb the abuses and provide investor protections.

Some crypto market participants seem compelled to repeat history. The wreckage of the early movers in the crypto industry included substantial criminal activity at FTX, and questionable business models at some of the crypto-lending firms that encompassed high-risk activities that had resulted in countless failures in traditional lending firms.

There were only a few of us sounding the alarms about these firms before their failures.

Customers did not understand that they were at risk. The failure of these cryptocurrency related firms had a significant impact on certain customers, and a negative impact on all their customers. Since the firms did not hold themselves out to be alternatives to traditional banks there were few, if any, customers who relied upon these firms to the exclusion of a traditional banking relationship.

Fintech Firms

Some customer-facing fintech firms do market themselves as alternatives to the traditional banking sector. These fintech companies provide a customer experience or set of products and services that may not be available from traditional banks, and hence appeal to a certain set of customers.

Fintech firms do not operate completely independently, and generally require the services of what is usually called a “partner bank.” The banking relationship is needed for a number of reasons including holding the customer deposits and access to the traditional payment systems.

Banks in the USA are exiting the business of partner banking, and in an article published earlier this month, I discuss the withdrawal of banking support for customer-facing fintech firms.

While banks are subject to rigorous supervision, required capital levels, and safety and soundness standards, fintech firms are not covered by those strong regulatory requirements. Fintech companies are generally required to have some form of regulatory permission to operate, but those licenses are lightyears away from the highly regulated operating environment for banks chartered in the USA.

Fintech firms are also not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC provides depositors insurance against the failures of banks, and as reported on the FDIC website, since FDIC insurance began in 1934, no depositor has lost a single penny of insured funds due to bank failure. There is no question that FDIC insurance is one of the many reasons for the strength of the U.S. banking system.

The FDIC only insures against the failure of a bank, and not the failure of a fintech intermediary. Therefore, as long as the bank continues to remain in good condition, if a fintech fails customers are potentially completely exposed should the customer’s funds not have been properly secured.

The FDIC operates to ensure that bank customers have continuous access to their funds. In the highly unlikely event that a bank becomes troubled to the point the FDIC is required to intervene, the insurance agency generally does so after the close of normal business hours so that by the time the bank reopens the next business day the customer accounts are transferred to a well-capitalized entity. The goal is to ensure that customers are not impacted.

Customer funds deposited in a fintech, which are then placed in a bank, may not even be covered in the event that the bank fails. The insurance relied upon in such an occurrence is the FDIC pass-through insurance, and there are conditions that must be met for such insurance to apply. Customers of fintech entities are therefore not even guaranteed insurance in the highly unusual event of a bank failure since the customer is relying upon the fintech firm to maintain all the conditions for pass-through insurance.

Customers have an expectation that their funds will always be safe, and banking in the USA is virtually synonymous with FDIC-insured banking. Fintech providers are neither necessarily safe nor insured. The gulf between the consumer protections for a FDIC-insured bank compared to any non-bank fintech is so vast that comparisons are virtually meaningless.

Moving Forward

Financial innovation is generally a net positive, and placing customer funds at risk, especially when customers may not fully understand the risks they are undertaking, is by definition a net negative.

The current system of standalone fintech firms that treat traditional banks as account servicers and infrastructure providers should be phased out. Sustainable growth will be found through a combination of the strength of the traditional banking system with the innovation of the financial technology industry.

Joint ventures between banks and fintech companies are the way of the future.

Through joint ventures the fintech industry may be brought into the well-regulated banking industry, and customers will benefit from the safety and security of bank supervision. The passage of the responsibility for ensuring customer funds are safe to the banks will result in the banks caring far more about the operation of fintech firms. Standards for capital, technology, compliance, and the management of the fintech enterprise will be required as banks are expected to be managed safely, provide uninterrupted customer service, and to be fully in compliance with all applicable regulations.

The banking industry must be in the leadership position when it comes to financial innovation. The banks should take the lead in these ventures for management, compliance, and ensuring safety & soundness.

Fintech companies should be seeking to find banks to engage in joint-ventures. Banks should identify ideas, technologies, and teams for which they wish to be associated, and to enter strategic discussions. The economics need to be fair, however, and that means that the banks should receive significant participation in the upside.

Customers in the USA deserve the protections of the highly regulated banking system whenever they entrust their money to an entity that offers banking-like services.

                    Trump family gets 75% of crypto coin revenue, has no liability, new document reveals
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, published a 13-page document Thursday that described its mission and how tokens can be allocated, and that indicated that the Republican presidential nominee and his family could take home 75% of net revenue. In what it calls the “World Liberty Gold Paper,” World Liberty Financial, or WLF, said the Trump family will receive 22.5 billion ”$WLFI” tokens, currently valued at $337.5 million, based on the price of 1.5 cents per token at launch this week. Trump, who’s in a virtual dead heat with Vice President Kamala Harris as the election reaches its closing stages, has spent months pumping his crypto project, previously branding it as “The DeFiant Ones,” a play on DeFi, short for decentralized finance. On Tuesday, the project launched the WLFI token and said in a roadmap that it was looking to raise $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in its initial sale. As of Thursday, only $12.9 million worth of the token has been sold, according to its website. The paper released Thursday shows that Trump and his family assume no liability. It indicates that none of them are directors, employees, managers or operators of WLF or its affiliates, and said the project and the tokens “are not political and have no affiliation with any political campaign.” WLF didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign referred questions to the Trump Organization, which didn’t immediately responded to a request for comment. Crypto projects typically release white papers before they launch their coins, offering a guide so that investors can learn more about the mission, goals and how future tokens get allocated. WLF’s paper says that a Delaware-based company named DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is connected to the former president, is set to receive three-quarters of the net protocol revenues. WLF bills itself as a crypto bank where customers will be encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in digital coins. The document released Thursday defines net protocol revenue as income to WLF from “any source, including without limitation platform use fees, token sale proceeds, advertising or other sources of revenue, after deduction of agreed expenses and reserves for WLF’s continued operations.” Some $30 million of the initial revenue is earmarked to be held in a reserve intended to cover operating expenses and other financial obligations. The remaining 25% of net protocol revenue is set to go to Axiom Management Group, or AMG, a Puerto Rico LLC wholly owned by Chase Herro and Zachary Folkman, two of the co-founders. Folkman previously had a company called Date Hotter Girls and reportedly helped develop crypto project Dough Finance. Herro worked on Dough and launched another crypto trading business a decade ago called Pacer Capital, which appears to now be defunct. AMG has agreed to allocate half of its rights to net protocol revenues to a third LLC called WC Digital Fi, which is an affiliate of Trump’s close friend and political donor, Steve Witkoff, as well as to “certain of his family members.” Witkoff’s son, Zachary, is also listed as one of the co-founders of the project. Folkman previously said just 20% of WLF’s tokens would be allotted to the founding team, which includes the Trump family. The paper spells out the breakdown of anticipated coin allocation, with 35% of total supply allocated to the token sale, 32.5% to community growth and incentives, 30% to initial support allocation, and 2.5% to team and advisors. The document specifies in the fine print that these “anticipated token distribution amounts are subject to change.” It’s unclear which categories include Trump and his family. The paper calls Trump the “chief crypto advocate.” His three sons are all “Web3 ambassadors.”

                    AI, crypto and data privacy: Comparing Harris, Trump on technology regulation
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            It's not surprising that technology regulation is an important issue in the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign.

The past decade has seen advanced technologies, from social media algorithms to large language model artificial intelligence systems, profoundly affect society. These changes, which spanned the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations, spurred calls for the federal government to regulate the technologies and the powerful corporations that wield them.

As a researcher of information systems and AI, I examined both candidates' records on technology regulation. Here are the important differences.

Algorithmic harms

With artificial intelligence now widespread, governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate various aspects of the technology. The candidates offer different visions for U.S. AI policy. One area where there is a stark difference is in recognizing and addressing algorithmic harms from the widespread use of AI technology.

AI affects your life in ways that might escape your notice. Biases in algorithms used for lending and hiring decisions could end up reinforcing a vicious cycle of discrimination. For example, a student who can't get a loan for college would then be less likely to get the education needed to pull herself out of poverty.

At the AI Safety Summit in Britain in November 2023, Harris spoke of the promise of AI but also the perils from algorithmic bias, deepfakes and wrongful arrests. Biden signed an executive order on AI on Oct. 30, 2023, that recognized AI systems can pose unacceptable risks of harm to civil and human rights and individual well-being. In parallel, federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission have carried out enforcement actions to guard against algorithmic harms.

By contrast, the Trump administration did not take a public stance on mitigation of algorithmic harms. Trump has said he wants to repeal President Biden's AI executive order. In recent interviews, however, Trump noted the dangers from technologies such as deepfakes and challenges posed to security from AI systems, suggesting a willingness to engage with the growing risks from AI.

Technological standards

The Trump administration signed the American AI Initiative executive order on Feb. 11, 2019. The order pledged to double AI research investment and established the first set of national AI research institutes. The order also included a plan for AI technical standards and established guidance for the federal government's use of AI. Trump also signed an executive order on Dec. 3, 2020, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the federal government.

The Biden-Harris administration has tried to go further. Harris convened the heads of Google, Microsoft and other tech companies at the White House on May 4, 2023, to undertake a set of voluntary commitments to safeguard individual rights. The Biden administration's executive order contains an important initiative to probe the vulnerablity of very large-scale, general-purpose AI models trained on massive amounts of data. The goal is to determine the risks hackers pose to these models, including the ones that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT and DALL-E.

Antitrust law enforcement -- restricting or conditioning mergers and acquisitions -- is another way the federal government regulates the technology industry.

The Trump administration's antitrust dossier includes its attempt to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. The merger was eventually allowed by a federal judge after the FTC under the Trump administration filed a suit to block the deal. The Trump administration also filed an antitrust case against Google focused on its dominance in internet search.

Biden signed an executive order on July 9, 2021, to enforce antitrust laws arising from the anticompetitive effects of dominant internet platforms. The order also targeted the acquisition of nascent competitors, the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets and the surveillance of users. The Biden-Harris administration has filed antitrust cases against Apple and Google.

The Biden-Harris administration's merger guidelines in 2023 outlined rules to determine when mergers can be considered anticompetitive. While both administrations filed antitrust cases, the Biden administration's antitrust push appears stronger in terms of its impact in potentially reorganizing or even orchestrating a breakup of dominant companies such as Google.

Cryptocurrency

The candidates have different approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Late in his administration, Trump tweeted in support of cryptocurrency regulation. Also late in Trump's administration, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network proposed regulations that would have required financial firms to collect the identity of any cryptocurrency wallet to which a user sent funds. The regulations were not enacted.

Trump has since shifted his position on cryptocurrencies. He has criticized existing U.S. laws and called for the United States to be a Bitcoin superpower. The Trump campaign is the first presidential campaign to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.

The Biden-Harris administration, by contrast, has laid out regulatory restrictions on cryptocurrencies with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought about a series of enforcement actions. The White House vetoed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act that aimed to clarify accounting for cryptocurrencies, a bill favored by the cryptocurrency industry.

Data privacy

Biden's AI executive order calls on Congress to adopt privacy legislation, but it does not provide a legislative framework to do so. The Trump White House's American AI Initiative executive order mentions privacy only in broad terms, calling for AI technologies to uphold "civil liberties, privacy, and American values." The order did not mention how existing privacy protections would be enforced.

Across the United States, several states have tried to pass legislation addressing aspects of data privacy. At present, there is a patchwork of statewide initiatives and a lack of comprehensive data privacy legislation at the federal level.

The paucity of federal data privacy protections is a stark reminder that while the candidates are addressing some of the challenges posed by developments in AI and technology more broadly, a lot still remains to be done to regulate technology in the public interest.

Overall, the Biden administration's efforts at antitrust and technology regulation seem broadly aligned with the goal of reining in technology companies and protecting consumers. It's also reimagining monopoly protections for the 21st century. This seems to be the chief difference between the two administrations.

                    Trump family will get 75% of crypto token revenue
                </h3>

                            (The Hill) -- The Trump family's cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, indicated in a report released Thursday that DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Delaware-based company connected to the former president, could get 75 percent of WLF's protocol revenues.

World Liberty Financial, spearheaded by two of Trump’s sons — Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.— was launched nearly a month ago and came as the industry has increasingly expressed frustration with the approach that the Biden administration and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler have taken toward crypto enforcement. 

In the report, net protocol revenues "include revenues to WLF from any source, including without limitation platform use fees, token sale proceeds, advertising or other sources of revenue, after deduction of agreed expenses and reserves for WLF’s continued operations."

The report notes that the platform and the WLFI tokens, released earlier this week, are not political and are not affiliated with any political campaign. It also said that Trump and his family assume no liability.

The report said that $30 million will be held in a reserve dedicated to operating expenses and obligations. 

Axiom Management Group LLC, a Puerto Rican limited liability company, can receive 7.5 billion WLFI tokens and 25 percent of net protocol revenue, according to the report.

Axios reported Thursday that the platform has sold 4 percent of its tokens.

                    Potential health hazards of cryptocurrency mines laid bare by scientists
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">

                            In summer 2024, several news outlets chronicled the "nightmarish" impacts Texas communities endured due to the din of noise emanating from nearby cryptocurrency mines.

Residents of these communities reported that the unrelenting noise caused them to experience a range of ailments, including high blood pressure, chest pain and tinnitus. The noise levels of the cryptocurrency mines allegedly reached 72 decibels — well above the 55 dB limit beyond which the World Health Organization (WHO) deems to be increasingly dangerous for public health.

These recent reports have stoked ongoing discussions about the potential health hazards of cryptocurrency mining. In a thinkpiece published Sept. 26 in the journal JAMA, three scientists argue that we are experiencing a "digital oil boom" that could have serious health consequences for everyone — not only the communities that live near mines. This problem extends beyond noise pollution, encompassing health risks associated with increasing energy consumption and accelerated climate change.

Energy-intensive mines

Cryptocurrency, a virtual currency that harnesses the blockchain, uses a network of computers to report transactions between users, which are documented in a digital ledger. The network is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled or owned by any one person or group, unlike a traditional central bank, for instance. This structure allows users to transfer currency more quickly and cheaply and with less of a paper trail, compared with traditional banking.

Since its advent, cryptocurrency has experienced several bubbles and crashes — however, it still remains popular worldwide, and the cryptocurrency market has now become a multibillion-dollar industry.

The first and arguably most popular type of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which was invented in 2009. Bitcoin relies on something called a "proof-of-work" algorithm, a calculation that essentially verifies the accuracy of transactions added to the digital ledger. The process of completing these calculations is very energy-intensive, and it becomes exponentially more difficult over time.

Consequently, Bitcoin data centers, referred to as "mines," require more and more energy to function over time. In the U.S. alone, cryptocurrency mining is estimated to represent around 0.6% to 2.3% of all electricity consumption in the country.

The energy-hungry industry could raise communities' reliance on peaking power plants, meaning power plants that kick in only at times of peak demand, Mary Willis, co-author of the JAMA article and an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, told Live Science.

The problem is that these plants run on fossil fuels. In terms of their direct impacts, these fumes contain air pollutants that can partly drive diseases, such as stroke, heart disease and lung cancer. Historically disadvantaged racial or ethnic communities are most likely to carry the burden of these health impacts, as plants are often built where those communities live.

Beyond harmful air pollutants, higher demands for fossil fuels also increases the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thus escalating climate change.

"Crypto mining uses mostly fossil fuel electricity, which comes from coal and natural gas power plants," Benjamin Jones, an associate professor of economics at the University of New Mexico who was not involved in the JAMA article, told Live Science in an email.

"These in-turn generate emissions of CO2 and other air pollutants, which contribute to climate change and harm human health," he said. Such harmful effects include spurring the spread of infectious diseases and the number of deaths tied to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and major storms.

Blackouts and noise pollution

Another concern is that many cryptocurrency mines are in locations with fragile electrical grids, such as Texas, Willis said. A winter storm in February 2021 caused the states' power grid to fail and highlighted its precarity.

Crypto mines could put additional stress on the grid, exacerbating the risk of blackouts, Willis said. Power outages can have numerous health consequences, including raising the risk of carbon-monoxide poisoning from generators; gastrointestinal illnesses as refrigerators stop working; and deaths in hospitals due to medical equipment shutting down.

On top of these risks related to energy use, cryptocurrency mines can be really noisy. Many communities are extremely worried about this, Willis told Live Science. Exposure to high levels of noise is associated with sleep disturbances, increased blood pressure and heart disease, among other health issues. Excessive noise has also been tied to inflammation in the brain, which may have knock-on impacts in the circulatory system.

For now, many of these health effects are theoretical. Besides anecdotal reports out of places like Texas, there isn't much good data on the health impacts of these mines, Willis said. For starters, there's currently no systematic way to actually track where the mines are located, she said.

In February 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration launched a system to track energy consumption from cryptocurrency mines. At the time, the agency said it had identified 137 mines in 21 U.S. states, with Texas, Georgia and New York hosting the majority.

But a month later, this data collection was discontinued following a federal court case initiated by the crypto industry, the JAMA authors wrote. In this case, it was successfully argued that government monitoring would cause "irreparable injury" to the industry.

Without data on the locations and energy use of crypto mines, it will be impossible to fully understand the health implications of cryptocurrency mining, Willis and her co-authors argued.

The trio is now trying to figure out the best way to locate these mines. Only then, they say, might these predictions about the health impacts of the mines be confirmed.

                    India Re-Claims Top Spot in Chainalysis' Global Crypto Adoption Index
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            Despite its strict regulatory stance on the crypto sector, India has shown notable growth in crypto adoption. This week, blockchain research firm Chainalysis released its '2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index', where India ranked first out of 151 nations. The country leads in overall crypto adoption, centralised service value, and retail centralised service value. Remarkably, this is the second consecutive year India has claimed the top spot, having also ranked first last year for the highest grassroots adoption of cryptocurrencies globally.

According to the Chainalysis report, India falls within the Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) region. The report highlights that the CSAO region leads the world in crypto sector growth, with crypto asset inflows totaling approximately $750 billion (around Rs. 63.05 lakh crore) between July 2023 and June 2024.

“CSAO dominates our 2024 index, with seven of the top 20 countries located in the region. CSAO has a unique set of crypto markets with high levels of activity on local crypto exchanges, with merchant services, and in DeFi,” the report said.Sam Altman Rebrands Controversial ‘Worldcoin’ Project as World: All Details

India's Crypto Landscape

In India, cryptocurrencies are viewed as virtual digital assets suited for investment and trading, though none are recognised as legal tender alongside the Indian Rupee (INR).

Since 2022, the government has imposed a 30 percent tax on capital gains from crypto activities and a 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) on every transaction. According to the finance ministry, this measure is crucial for tracking crypto transactions, which are often difficult to trace due to their anonymity.

In December last year, India mandated that all firms dealing with cryptocurrencies must obtain an operational license from the national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).Delhi Police Uncovers Renewable Energy Scam With Help From Binance

Despite these evolving regulations, crypto-related fraud and hacking incidents have surged in India. In July this year, the country's crypto sector was shaken when hackers breached a wallet on the WazirX exchange, resulting in losses exceeding $230 million (around Rs. 1,900 crore). While WazirX has been cooperating with authorities like CERT-In to investigate the breach, an official statement from the finance ministry is still awaited.

Commenting on India's approach towards the crypto sector, Chainalysis said, “The good news is that India's path to crypto adoption is becoming clearer, due to continued engagement between the industry and regulators. Although this shift is more recent, we look forward to seeing how India's crypto market develops in the coming years.”

More Observations from Chainalysis

After India, Nigeria, Indonesia, the US, and Vietnam secured the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively, in the overall crypto adoption rankings.

Meanwhile, Ukraine, Russia, Phillipines, Pakistan, Brazil, and Turkey are ahead of the UK on the Chainalysis index – despite UK's decisions to bring comprehensive rules to govern the crypto industry.

Chainalysis reported that in 2023, the growth in crypto adoption was primarily driven by lower-middle-income countries. This year, however, crypto-related activities have surged across countries in all income brackets.

The report further noted that, “Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the total value of global crypto activity increased substantially, reaching higher levels than those of 2021 during the crypto bull market.”

The report indicated that the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US contributed to a significant rise in Bitcoin activity across all regions.

Discussing the US crypto market, Chainalysis highlighted that the country has the largest and most influential market globally, standing out by a considerable margin.

                            NICOSIA – Cyprus will not accept applications from Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) for now as the European Union is setting regulations by year’s end that moves the sector away from national laws.

The industry will be regulated under the EU’s Common Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations by Dec. 30, and theCyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has frozen CASP applications, said Coin Telegraph.

CASPs that succeed in registering under the national laws before the Dec. 30 deadline will be able to operate under that jurisdiction until July 1, 2026, unless they are granted or refused authorization under MiCA Article 63 before then.

CASPs will be subject to the European Commission’s Regulatory Technical Standards and the Implementing Technical Standards once MiCA regulations kick in, the crypto following news site site.

Those standards have not been published yet, but the CySEC advised interested parties to refer to the Draft Technical Standards issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in the meantime.

On Oct. 30, the CySEC will stop accepting notifications under its national rules from entities in the European Economic Area of their intentions to provide services in Cyprus. Entities that file a notification before then will be able to operate under the same conditions as local entities through July 1, 2026.

                            Cyprus, with its sunny climate, beautiful beaches and rich heritage, is undoubtedly an attractive destination for many. But did you know that it’s also a burgeoning hub for cryptocurrency? In this guide, we’ll delve into the world of cryptocurrency in Cyprus to uncover how this country is establishing itself as a front-runner in the realm of digital currencies.

Cryptocurrency: A brief overview

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, it’s not issued by a central bank or government. Instead, it operates on a decentralised network called a blockchain. This technology ensures transparency, security and immutability.

Regulatory landscape in Cyprus

Cyprus has taken a progressive stance towards cryptocurrency. While it doesn’t have specific laws solely for cryptocurrencies, it leverages existing financial services legislation to regulate them. This approach provides a framework for businesses operating in the crypto space.

The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) is the primary regulator overseeing financial services in Cyprus. The CySEC has formulated a regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies that provides clear guidelines and promotes a healthy environment for trading crypto in this country. This in turn helps to encourage innovation and attract investors.

Capital requirements

If you’re considering starting a cryptocurrency-related business in Cyprus, you’ll need to meet certain capital requirements. These requirements will vary depending on the specific type of business you’re planning to set up.

There are two types of cryptocurrency funds in Cyprus: AIFUNP (Alternative Investment Fund with an Unlimited Number of Persons) and AIFLNP (AIFs with a Limited Number of Persons). Such internally managed funds must adhere to minimum capital requirements stipulated by CySEC.

Ahead of setting up your business, it is essential to consult with a local financial advisor or lawyer to understand the exact capital requirements for your future venture.

Buying, selling and storing your crypto

Several cryptocurrency exchanges operate in Cyprus, offering various digital assets and payment methods. The most widely accepted cryptocurrencies in this country include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin, as well as some homegrown crypto exchanges.

If you are interested in buying, selling and storing your cryptocurrency assets, you should opt to use a trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange like Tradu. These platforms allow you to trade various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies in a safe and secure environment.

When choosing an exchange, it’s essential to consider factors such as security, fees and the range of cryptocurrencies offered. Additionally, you need to give careful consideration as to how you would prefer to store your cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. There are different types of wallets, including hot wallets (connected to the internet) and cold wallets (offline).
