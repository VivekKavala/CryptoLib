                Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Ether bounced back this week. (Photo by S3studio/Getty Images) 2018 S3studio Ether has shown its strength recently, bouncing back after becoming severely undervalued compared to bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value rose above $2,700 this week, reaching its highest value since late August, Coinbase figures provided by TradingView reveal. The digital asset has rallied close to 20% since September 18, additional Coinbase data reveals. This upward movement started the same day the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it was cutting the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points, a move that provided tailwinds for global risk assets. “Basically all crypto has been rallying since the Fed rate cut, but ETH has rallied stronger than Bitcoin, for example, because it has underperformed Bitcoin since The Merge (September 2022) and is now approaching extreme undervalued levels against it,” Moreno said via Telegram. The chart below, which leverages CryptoQuant data, helps depict this situation. The black line shows the ratio of ether prices to those of bitcoin. The purple line, on the other hand, displays the Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) of ether relative to that of bitcoin.

Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, September 25 Ether and bitcoin's price and Market Value to Realised Value CryptoQuant Ether’s ‘Recent Underperformance’ Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also emphasized how ether’s price has failed to keep up with that of bitcoin. “ETH has been underperforming BTC for most of the summer,” he stated via email. “That started to change with the US Federal Reserve’s 50 bps reduction in interest rates as, for some reason, ETH has reacted more bullishly than BTC,” Enneking noted. “The only reason we can come up with is that ETH is simply compensating for its recent underperformance,” he specified. “We do not see this as a secular shift back to the BTC-ETH ratio before ETH switched to POS from POW,” Enneking clarified. Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, also weighed in, offering a similar take. “Ethereum is currently experiencing a price recovery, but this seems more like a correction than a rally, as it has been undervalued in recent weeks,” she said via email. “On September 20th, the ETH/BTC ratio dipped to 0.038, its lowest point since April 2021, signaling that Ethereum had been priced too cheaply,” Liu added. “Last week, Ethereum's price erased all of its year-to-date gains, as if the much-anticipated ETH ETF had never happened,” she stated, shedding further light on the matter. “Meanwhile, alternative Layer 1s like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) have posted strong performances this year,” the analyst noted. “This underscores the clear undervaluation of ETH, and the current price recovery appears to be aligning it with the broader market.” Bullish Outlook Going forward, ether could be headed for substantial gains, stated Liu. “Ethereum is showing signs of repeating its 2021 pattern, with a potential for significant upside and volatility ahead,” she said. “The Ethereum blockchain continues to dominate, with the most active developers, the largest number of active users, and has a market cap almost five times that of its competitor Solana. With strong fundamentals, it seems poised for another potential rally, Liu concluded. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
