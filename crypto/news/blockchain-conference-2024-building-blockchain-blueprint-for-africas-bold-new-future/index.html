                On September 11, 2024, BusinessDay hosted its inaugural Blockchain Conference at Radisson Blu, Victoria Island, Lagos. The theme, “Building Africa’s Future: Harnessing Blockchain for Social and Economic Transformation,” resonated deeply with the discussions and presentations of the day. Opening Remarks Frank Aigbogun, publisher and chief executive officer, of BusinessDay Media Limited represented by Lolade Akinmurele, deputy editor, of BusinessDay Media Limited said blockchain is no longer just an idea for the future; it’s here and shaping the present. From finance and healthcare to governance and beyond, the potential is vast. Governments use blockchain for land registries in countries like Ukraine, Estonia, and Georgia. Azerbaijan is working on digital identities (IDs) for banking, and Switzerland is positioning itself as a blockchain hub. These examples remind us that Africa, too, can leverage blockchain for growth. Aigbogun highlighted blockchain’s ability to bring transparency, trust, and inclusivity, addressing key challenges across the continent, such as financial exclusion and inefficiencies in governance. Blockchain offers a decentralised system where transactions are secure and transparent, making it an essential tool for fostering economic growth and social equity.

Highlights Blockchain for Industry Transformation: Blockchain can drive financial inclusion and efficiency across African sectors, offering innovative solutions to economic and social challenges. Changing Blockchain’s Narrative: There’s a need to focus on blockchain’s potential for positive impact rather than its negative portrayal. Understanding Before Regulation: Regulators must fully understand blockchain technology before creating rules, ensuring that smart contracts and other blockchain innovations are safely integrated. Economic Potential of Blockchain: Blockchain can resolve land ownership issues, unlock trapped capital, and democratise asset ownership through tokenisation, enabling more people to access credit. Social Change and Transparency: Blockchain can address societal issues like corruption by making processes like voting and government procurement more accountable and transparent. Financial Inclusion and Efficiency: Blockchain can extend access to financial services for unbanked populations, speeding up transactions and creating a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Encouraging Innovation Among Youth: Africa’s youth, leading the technological charge, are well-positioned to drive blockchain development, especially in areas like decentralised applications and social impact bonds. Regulation for Growth: Effective regulation is crucial for guiding blockchain innovation without stifling it, creating a stable environment for sustainable development. Global Alignment: Nigeria’s regulatory framework aligns with international standards, boosting cross-border collaboration and investor confidence. Trust Between Innovators and Regulators: Mutual trust is essential, with regulators guiding the industry responsibly and innovators adhering to rules to build confidence in the system. Patriotism and National Development: Innovators were encouraged to prioritise the country’s welfare over personal gain, contributing to Nigeria’s development through responsible blockchain solutions. Balancing Transparency and Privacy: There’s a need to strike the right balance between transparency in blockchain transactions and maintaining privacy for users. Collaboration for a Better Future: The importance of partnerships between regulators, innovators, and other stakeholders to unlock blockchain’s full potential and build strong institutions for economic development. Highlights of the Director General of National Information Technolgy Development Agency’s Keynote Address Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, director general of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), represented by Ayodele Bakare, delivered a keynote speech on “National Digital Economy Policies, Strategies, and the Role of Blockchain Technology,” covering several key themes: Abdullahi’s speech highlighted Nigeria’s digital economy strategy, which focuses on infrastructure development, skills acquisition, innovation support, cybersecurity, and data protection. Blockchain’s role in sectors like financial services, land registry, education, and agriculture was emphasised. NITDA supports blockchain adoption through policy frameworks, partnerships, and a regulatory sandbox. Challenges such as lack of awareness and technical expertise were acknowledged, but blockchain was seen as an opportunity for Nigeria to lead Africa’s digital innovation.

Keynote Address by Senior Research and Data Analyst at BusinessDay Intelligence In his keynote address Mohammed Akonji, senior Research and Data analyst at BusinessDay Intelligence, made a compelling case for decentralising digital infrastructure, citing global internet outages, including the July 2024 incident that caused $5 trillion in lost revenue. He stressed the vulnerabilities of centralised systems and advocated for blockchain as a solution to eliminate intermediaries, increase transparency, and enhance various sectors like financial services and supply chain management. Blockchain Growth and Africa’s Untapped Potential BusinessDay Intelligence’s research shows explosive blockchain growth, from $1 billion globally in 2020 to $30 billion by 2023, with projections suggesting it could reach $1.8 trillion by 2034. While North America dominates with 46 per cent of the global market, Africa and the Middle East only account for 2 per cent, highlighting massive opportunities for Africa’s economic development. Akonji called for greater investment and understanding of blockchain’s potential in Africa, especially in financial inclusion, healthcare, and supply chain management. Real-World Applications of Blockchain Akonji presented two powerful examples: ● 2018 World Food Programme (WFP) Initiative in Jordan: Blockchain was used to distribute aid to refugees, cutting out intermediaries and saving $1.5 million. ● Global Digital Identification: Over 1 billion people lack formal IDs, and blockchain could help provide secure digital identities, contributing to global development goals. Opportunities for Nigeria Akonji identified key areas for blockchain’s transformative potential in Nigeria: ● Financial Services: Decentralised finance (DeFi) could improve banking access for rural and underserved populations. ● Supply Chain: Blockchain can track fuel consumption and prevent smuggling, ensuring transparency in Nigeria’s petroleum industry. ● Healthcare: Blockchain could revolutionise record-keeping, reduce fraud, and improve patient outcomes in the healthcare sector. BusinessDay Intelligence’s Role As a leading research body, BusinessDay Intelligence is committed to fostering blockchain adoption in Nigeria through: ● Advocacy and Awareness: Educating the public about blockchain’s benefits, noting that only 20 per cent of Nigerians understand how it works. ● Market Research: Providing data-driven insights on blockchain trends, opportunities, and challenges. ● Security and Risk Management: Offering expert analysis on cybersecurity risks and safeguarding digital infrastructure. Akonji concluded with a call to action, urging Nigerian businesses and government agencies to harness blockchain technology for social and economic progress. BusinessDay Intelligence aims to engage stakeholders in unlocking blockchain’s full potential for Africa’s future.
