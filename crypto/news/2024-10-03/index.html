                    Team Ireland gets ready to capture title at European Cyber Security Challenge
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            A team from Ireland will be competing at the annual European Cyber Security Challenge in
                            Turin from 7-11 October. The event brings together teams of 10 from 31 countries from
                            European and six invited nations to compete in on-site in Capture The Flag (CTF) style
                            competitions. Each team’s players are aged under 25, and at least half must be aged 20 or
                            under. Team manager and lecturer in cyber security at TU Dublin Mark Lane spoke to
                            TechCentral about the process of putting the team together. How was the team assembled? It’s
                            a long and varied process in fact and continues to evolve as we grow interest in CTFs/Team
                            Ireland and grow the number of participants. For this year’s competition we actually started
                            the process last year as soon as we returned from the 2023 European Cyber Security Challenge
                            in Hamar, Norway. We held large CTF events for schools with UCD’s Cyberwise, and with TU
                            Dublin late last year. We also ran several smaller CTFs for colleges and companies earlier
                            this year, and our flagship CTF, ZeroDays CTF was held in Croke Park in March. Any students
                            who engaged in these events and scored well were invited to try out more CTF challenges at
                            our website. That website is up and running year-round so anyone that does well there can be
                            invited to join us for some online CTFs and training. If they engage online and show promise
                            they are invited to join our squad of candidates for the Irish CTF team. From this process
                            we emerged with around 35 candidates in May. Over the summer we held several in-person
                            bootcamps and training sessions for the squad and eventually picked the final 10 players
                            (plus two reserves) in late August. Next year we will tweak the process again as we’re
                            hoping to have more regional CTFs as part of a national CTF competition for schools and
                            colleges. Was there any concern about how you would work as a team over having individual
                            skills? We are very conscious of the team dynamic and making sure we have a harmonious camp,
                            where everyone feels included and part of something. Because we meet in-person regularly
                            over the summer, we do get to know the candidates well. We have an excellent team spirit,
                            and one of the things I love to see is the players becoming friends outside of the CTFs. We
                            are very inclusive and recognise that diversity is really important to a strong team. Also,
                            most CTFs are team-based, and feature challenges across a range of fairly standard
                            categories these days. As the ECSC continues to mature, we know the categories involved, so
                            we can choose the final team based on having a balance of skills to compliment the
                            categories of the challenges. Is it important to be an all-island team? Absolutely. If we
                            look at sport as an example, most sports are now all-island teams, and that has obviously
                            been beneficial in terms of success and in terms of cross-community bridge building too. We
                            are a small island, and we are competing against some European powerhouses in terms of
                            population bases and resourcing. So, the bigger the base of players we can have the better.
                            It would be a shame to miss out on all of those potential players, and a shame to not give
                            them the opportunity to participate in what has become a massive annual event, in terms of
                            scope, size and importance. This year two of our 10 are from Belfast, and hopefully they are
                            just the first of many from the North. This year we truly are an all-island team with
                            players from Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Donegal, and everywhere in between. We’re also a very
                            diverse team in terms of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, gender, LGBTQ+ and
                            neurodiversity. We are a team for everyone, and that diversity really does make us stronger
                            in terms of skills, outlook and team spirit. Players want to stay involved afterwards, and
                            it’s great to be able to draw on their experience now to help coach the next generation. In
                            fact, our previous two captains, Emmet Leahy and Daniel Cahill, are now coaching the team.
                            How does the competition work? The ECSC has been running since 2016 in it’s current guise.
                            We actually took part that year along with nine other teams, in Dusseldorf, Germany. It has
                            grown year-on-year (apart from two years when it didn’t run due to Covid). This year is the
                            biggest so far, with 31 EU/EFTA (European Free Trade Agreement) countries competing, along
                            with six guest countries including Australia, Kosovo and Singapore. The two days of
                            competition are gruelling. The first day is a traditional ‘jeopardy’ style CTF, where teams
                            will complete challenges across a range of categories such as cryptography (crypto), binary
                            exploitation (pwn), web exploitation (web), reverse engineering (rev), forensics, hardware
                            and miscellaneous (misc, which basically covers everything else including OSINT). As the
                            teams solve challenges they find flags, which they submit to earn points on the scoreboard.
                            The second day of competition is an attack/defence (A/D) CTF. In this type of CTF each team
                            is given a bunch (usually between six and eight) deliberately vulnerable servers/services.
                            They have to keep their services running to gain points, patch their own vulnerabilities and
                            exploit those of other teams. The points across the two days are averaged to decide the
                            winners. To make things more exciting the scoreboard is made invisible for the final two
                            hours each day, so the teams don’t know who’s leading. This makes the awards quite tense and
                            exciting. Germany are the current holders, and hosts Italy are favoured, though every year
                            there are dark horses that surprise everyone. Another evolution of this competition is the
                            International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC) which is in it’s third year, to be held in Chile
                            at the end of October. It’s a pan-continental CTF, which Team Europe has won for the first
                            two years. This year our Irish team captain Cillian Collins became the first Irish player to
                            make Team Europe, so that’s a sign of the progress we are making. Our team is run entirely
                            by volunteers, and we have made significant progress with very little resources. Resourcing
                            is an ongoing issue; if we want to keep growing and building we really need drastic
                            increases in resourcing and full-time staffing. This year we received grant funding from the
                            NCSC, which was a big help. We also received sponsorship from hot Irish threat-intelligence
                            start-up Cytidel and security service provider ReliaQuest, as well as support from ZeroDays
                            and TU Dublin. We wouldn’t be able to do it without that support, and we’re really hoping to
                            increase the funding substantially going forward. It’s good for everyone from the players,
                            to industry, to government, academia and the country for us to continue to build on what we
                            have achieved so far. As a lecturer how important do you think events like this are for
                            fostering young talent? Incredibly important, to be honest. There are lost of cyber security
                            initiatives happening aimed at young people. However, most of them are more focussed on
                            cyber security awareness. I genuinely believe that CTFs are the best way of finding,
                            encouraging and fostering young talent. I have been running ZeroDays CTF since 2015, but it
                            was only in 2022 that we had our first schools section in the competition. Having the
                            schools involved was amazing right from the start. Firstly we had 50% girls taking part,
                            which was way about the norm for STEM related activities. Secondly we found some incredible
                            raw talent. 2023 was our second year with schools taking part in ZeroDays Cyber Schools
                            category, and two 16-year-old participants from that ended up making the Irish team for the
                            ECSC in Norway last year. This year we had players as young as 14 making our squad of
                            candidates, with three under-18s (one as a reserve) making the team for Turin. This has been
                            from a still relatively small number of schools participating. In TU Dublin we have seen
                            record numbers of first year students choose cyber security on the CAO, and a substantial
                            percentage of them chose the course only after participating in our ZeroDays schools CTFs.
                            We have also seen a related increase in the number of female students joining. We have
                            around 25% female cyber security students in the past two years, which I’m told is (by a
                            fair margin) the highest percentage in the country. Next year we are hoping to announce a
                            new all-Ireland CTF competition for schools and colleges, as well as an accompanying course
                            and online resources. Still a lot of work to do on that, but it’s something my team is
                            passionate about making happen, and we are currently in talks to make it happen. TechCentral

                    XRP slides 9% after SEC appeals decision in landmark Ripple case
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">

                            The price of the XRP token tumbled Thursday, a day after the Securities and Exchange
                            Commission filed to appeal a 2023 court ruling that determined XRP is not considered a
                            security when sold to retail investors on exchanges. XRP was last lower by more than 9% at
                            52 cents a coin, according to Coin Metrics. Ripple, the largest holder of XRP coins, scored
                            a partial victory last summer after a three-year battle with the SEC. U.S. District Judge
                            Analisa Torres handed down the decision, which was hailed as a landmark win for the crypto
                            industry. Still, while XRP isn't considered a security when sold to retail investors on
                            exchanges, it is considered an unregistered security offering if sold to institutional
                            investors. Ripple declined to comment but referred to Wednesday evening posts on X by CEO
                            Brad Garlinghouse and chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty. Alderoty said the company is
                            evaluating whether to file a cross appeal, and called the SEC's decision to appeal
                            "disappointing, but not surprising." The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has become notorious
                            for its refusal to provide clear guidance for crypto businesses, instead opting to regulate
                            by enforcement actions. "XRP's status as a non-security is the law of the land today - and
                            that does not change even in the face of this misguided - and infuriating - appeal,"
                            Garlinghouse said on X. Earlier on Wednesday, Bitwise Asset Management, an issuer of ETFs
                            tracking bitcoin (BITB) and ether (ETHW), submitted a registration filing for what would be
                            the first XRP ETF – two days after registering an XRP trust product in Delaware. Grayscale,
                            which also has bitcoin (GBTC) and ether (ETHE) ETFs, introduced a similar trust product in
                            September. XRP, which was created by the founders of Ripple, is the native token of the open
                            source XRP Ledger, which Ripple uses in its cross-border payments business. It is the
                            fifth-largest coin by market cap, excluding stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).
                            Elsewhere in the crypto market, bitcoin hovered above the flat line at $60,210.29, while
                            ether fell more than 2% to $2,320.20. Crypto stocks Coinbase and MicroStrategy were lower by
                            about 1% and 2%, respectively.

                    BBVA eyes stablecoin launch backed by Visa collaboration for 2025
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            BBVA, one of Spain’s leading financial institutions, is pushing ahead with plans to
                            introduce its own stablecoin next year in a collaboration with Visa. This initiative is part
                            of Visa’s sandbox program designed to assist companies in developing tokenized assets.
                            BBVA’s new stablecoin aims to streamline digital transactions, focusing on providing a
                            secure settlement layer for asset tokenization, particularly in areas like real estate and
                            private credit funds. The project is still in its early phase, with BBVA navigating
                            regulatory frameworks and fine-tuning technical requirements for stablecoin issuance. The
                            bank has yet to decide on the backing of the currency, considering options like deposits,
                            money market funds, or fiat currencies such as the euro and U.S. dollar. The flexibility
                            around its backing will likely allow BBVA to adapt to evolving market demands, especially as
                            regulations around digital currencies continue to be clarified. Visa’s sandbox has been
                            instrumental in BBVA’s progress, offering a safe testing environment to explore the
                            potential of tokenized assets. The program, which has helped several firms launch digital
                            financial products, is seen as a crucial step in providing the bank with the tools and
                            guidance needed for a successful stablecoin rollout. While many other financial institutions
                            are still exploring the possibilities of blockchain and tokenization, BBVA’s decision to
                            move forward with a stablecoin is seen as a bold move. By 2025, the bank aims to enter live
                            testing, allowing for the currency’s use in various exchange settings. This is part of a
                            broader strategy by the bank to integrate more digital solutions into its operations,
                            reflecting the financial industry’s growing interest in blockchain technology. BBVA’s
                            stablecoin is expected to play a pivotal role in transforming the way large transactions are
                            settled. By tokenizing assets, the bank hopes to reduce transaction costs and improve
                            efficiency, particularly in traditionally cumbersome processes like real estate purchases
                            and private lending. It also aligns with broader trends in the financial sector where
                            tokenization is increasingly being used to streamline asset management and trading. The
                            stablecoin could also help BBVA tap into a growing demand for digital currencies, especially
                            as businesses and investors seek faster, more transparent ways of handling large
                            transactions. As part of this effort, BBVA has been working with regulators to ensure that
                            its stablecoin will meet all necessary compliance requirements, a key step in gaining
                            broader market acceptance. BBVA’s collaboration with Visa is not an isolated venture. Visa
                            has been heavily involved in developing digital currency frameworks, helping banks and
                            financial institutions innovate in the crypto space. Visa’s experience in handling global
                            payments and building scalable digital platforms is seen as a valuable asset in helping BBVA
                            bring its stablecoin to market. While it is still early days for BBVA’s stablecoin
                            initiative, the bank’s decision to move forward is an indicator of how seriously major
                            financial institutions are taking the future of digital currencies. By focusing on tokenized
                            assets and stablecoins, BBVA is positioning itself as a leader in the digital transformation
                            of the financial sector. This is particularly crucial as the banking industry faces
                            increased pressure to modernize its operations and offer more digital solutions to its
                            customers. Analysts expect BBVA’s stablecoin to be a game-changer, particularly in markets
                            where digital payments and blockchain-based solutions are gaining traction. However, there
                            are challenges ahead, especially as the bank finalizes its decision on the currency’s
                            backing and navigates complex regulatory landscapes. The success of the project will depend
                            on a combination of technological innovation, regulatory approval, and market adoption.

                            online for the first time can be both exciting and challenging. Here are some practical tips
                            to help you get started smoothly and increase your chances of a rewarding experience: 1.
                            Understand the Basics of Cryptocurrency: If you haven't already, familiarize yourself with
                            buying, storing, and using cryptocurrency. Set up a secure crypto wallet for your
                            transactions. 2. Start Small: When you’re new, it’s wise to start with smaller bets until
                            you get a feel for the games and understand how the crypto transactions work within the
                            casino. 3. Avail of Bonuses: Many crypto casino games to play online offer welcome bonuses,
                            free spins, or no-deposit bonuses. These can provide extra value but read the terms and
                            conditions for any wagering requirements. 4. Check the RTP and Volatility: Check its Return
                            to Player (RTP) percentage and volatility before playing a slot game. Higher RTP games offer
                            better long-term returns, while volatility indicates how often you can expect to win. 5. Set
                            a Budget: Effective bankroll management is crucial. Decide beforehand how much
                            cryptocurrency you are willing to risk and stick to that budget to avoid potentially losing
                            more than you can afford. 6. Learn the Game Features: Familiarize yourself with the slot
                            game’s features, such as paylines, bonuses, and wild symbols, which can affect gameplay and
                            enhance your chances of winning. 7. Play for Fun First: If available, try playing the slots
                            in demo mode first. This will help you understand the game mechanics without risking your
                            crypto. 8. Stay Informed: Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate wildly. To manage your funds
                            better, stay informed about the current value of the crypto you are using to play and win
                            slots. 9. Practice Responsible Gambling: Remember that gambling should be done for
                            entertainment, not to make money. Know when to stop, and do not chase losses. Can You Win
                            Real Money Playing Slots Online? Yes, you can indeed win real money playing slots online.
                            Reputable online casinos are regulated and use Random Number Generators (RNGs) to ensure
                            fair gameplay, mirroring the randomness of physical slot machines. Players deposit real
                            money into their casino accounts to bet on these games, and winnings are genuine monetary
                            gains that can be withdrawn according to each casino's rules. Online slots often offer a
                            more comprehensive selection than physical casinos, including games with high Return to
                            Player (RTP) percentages, which can improve winning chances. Additionally, many online
                            casinos offer free spins or no-deposit bonuses that increase your chances of winning without
                            additional risk. Particularly lucrative are the progressive jackpots, which can grow to be
                            worth millions of dollars. However, it’s essential to approach online slots cautiously, as
                            they are games of chance. Responsible gaming practices, such as setting spending limits and
                            knowing when to quit, are crucial to ensuring a safe and enjoyable gaming experience. How Do
                            You Play Online Slots with Cryptocurrency? Playing online slots with cryptocurrency is a
                            straightforward process combining the excitement of online gaming with the convenience and
                            security of digital currency. Here’s how you can get started: 1. Choose a Crypto Casino:
                            First, select an online casino that accepts cryptocurrency. Look for reputable platforms
                            that support your preferred cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. 2. Set
                            Up a Cryptocurrency Wallet: You need a cryptocurrency wallet like TrustWallet, MetaMask, or
                            others before depositing cryptocurrency into the casino. This digital wallet stores your
                            cryptocurrency and sends and receives funds. 3. Deposit Funds: Once your wallet is set up,
                            you can deposit cryptocurrency into your casino account. Navigate to the casino’s banking or
                            cashier section, select the deposit option, choose your cryptocurrency, and then transfer
                            funds from your wallet to the casino using the provided address. 4. Claim Any Bonuses: Many
                            crypto casinos offer welcome bonuses or promotions for new players. Check for any deposit
                            bonuses you can claim when you add funds. 5. Choose Your Slot Game: Browse the casino’s slot
                            game selection with funds in your account. Crypto casinos often offer various slots,
                            including classic, video, and progressive jackpot slots. 6. Adjust Your Bet Size: Adjust the
                            bet size to suit your budget before spinning the reels. Cryptocurrency casinos typically
                            show bets in their crypto equivalent, so watch how much you’re wagering. 7. Play the Game:
                            Now, you’re ready to play. Hit the spin button and watch the reels go. The rules and payouts
                            for crypto slots are similar to traditional online slots, so that the experience will be
                            familiar. 8. Withdraw Winnings: If you win and want to withdraw your earnings, return to the
                            cashier section, select withdraw, and transfer the winnings back to your cryptocurrency
                            wallet. Conclusion: Can You Win A Lot Of Money On Online Slots? Playing online slots, which
                            blend engaging entertainment with the chance to earn monetary rewards, can result in
                            significant wins. These online versions of traditional slot machines offer a broad array of
                            themes, cutting-edge features, and the flexibility to play from anywhere at any time.
                            Choosing a reputable, licensed online casino that guarantees fairness and security is
                            crucial to maximizing your chances of winning. Players can make more informed decisions by
                            understanding essential game mechanics such as paytables, RTP rates, and the role of random
                            number generators. Although online slots are primarily games of chance determined by RNGs,
                            opting for games with higher RTPs and strategically using bonuses can improve your odds.
                            Above all, adhering to responsible gambling practices is essential to ensuring that the
                            excitement of the game does not negatively impact personal well-being. With the right
                            approach, playing online slots can be rewarding and enjoyable. Advertising and Marketing by:

                            Images Bitcoin is the first, most popular, and biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.
                            However, many Bitcoin advocates draw a sharp contrast between bitcoin and the broader
                            “crypto” space. Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy and a bitcoin bull, voiced this on
                            CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." He said, "Speaking for all the bitcoiners, we feel trapped in
                            a bad relationship with crypto, and we want out." Why such a stark divide between terms that
                            appear closely related both linguistically and technologically? After all, every
                            cryptocurrency is built on blockchain — a technology that allows transferring digital assets
                            through a decentralized network, which maintains and updates the ever-growing transactions
                            ledger. The essence of “bitcoin, not crypto” lies in the concept of decentralization. So
                            far, no blockchain can compete with Bitcoin in this respect. However, we may still reconcile
                            this perspective with the existence of other blockchains by recognizing the different
                            purposes they serve. Decentralization Is A Spectrum Decentralization is a solution to
                            avoiding central authority flaws. Bitcoin is revolutionary in achieving a truly
                            decentralized value transfer system, based on cryptology and economic incentive — new
                            bitcoin and transaction fees paid to the miners. In return, miners invest in specialized
                            hardware and spend a lot of electricity. They do this to find proof-of-work for each block,
                            thus securing the blockchain. Miners are motivated to keep Bitcoin safe, operating, and most
                            importantly, censorship-resistant. An alternative to PoW is proof-of-stake, which requires
                            validators to stake the blockchain’s currency to prove their good intentions. This consensus
                            and its variations are now the most popular among blockchains, as they allow for higher
                            scalability. However, PoS can create an oligarchic system. The more coins you stake, the
                            higher your chances of adding a block and earning a reward. This makes you wealthier,
                            allowing you to stake more coins. Unlike bitcoin miners, whose power remains unchanged after
                            mining a block, PoS validators can grow their influence. MORE FOR YOU Today’s NYT Mini

                            Law—Musk Says Its ‘Score One’ For Free Speech Furthermore, centralization concerns extend
                            beyond the PoS consensus. A small number of nodes, liquid staking protocols pooling user
                            funds, nodes hosted by centralized services, high hardware requirements, and centralization
                            risks related to MEV (maximal extractable value) practices are just some of the problems
                            that most blockchains must face. On Ethereum, one of the most decentralized blockchains
                            other than Bitcoin, nearly 35% of staked coins come from the top three decentralized liquid
                            staking services, according to Dune Analytics. Another 20% come from the top three
                            centralized services. Additionally, 69% of Ethereum nodes are hosted by three centralized
                            providers, and 90% of the blocks are ordered by just three MEV-optimizing builders. With
                            1.16 TB, Ethereum blockchain weighs almost twice as much as Bitcoin (604 GB), making
                            participation harder for average users. Yes, most blockchains are much less decentralized
                            and therefore less censorship-resistant than Bitcoin. Moreover, unlike Bitcoin, which
                            Satoshi Nakamoto handed to the community less than two years after its launch, most other
                            blockchains are still tied to their founders. This group of insiders, including early
                            investors, often retains significant control, notably through pre-minted coins. This further
                            concentrates their wealth and power. Does this mean that the whole “crypto” space is
                            useless? It may be too early to say that. Decentralization is a spectrum, and even less
                            decentralized platforms still offer users more freedom and control than traditional web
                            services. This gives them the potential to serve various use cases beyond money. Not All
                            Cryptocurrencies Are Currencies Bitcoin’s primary goal is to create and sustain independent
                            money. As more people place their trust in bitcoin as an alternative to traditional
                            currencies, its value grows accordingly. In contrast, most other blockchains, like Ethereum
                            or Solana, were designed as multi-purpose smart contract platforms. Their goal is to enable
                            the development of decentralized applications, called dapps. Using these blockchains, the
                            next phase of the internet, known as Web3, could enable innovative use cases ranging from
                            gaming and social media to finance, commerce, and beyond. In this perspective, ether, the
                            native coin of Ethereum, is not a cryptocurrency. While it can be invested in or traded,
                            ether is more of a utility asset for Web3 than general-purpose money. Its primary role is to
                            power the Ethereum blockchain, functioning as payment for transactions and an incentive for
                            validators. As Ethereum-based dapps gain popularity, demand for ether increases to cover
                            transaction costs. Also, smart contract platforms’ founding teams often operate much like
                            traditional companies. They deal with issues like finding investment, solving technical
                            problems, building communities, and marketing their products. The value of these
                            blockchains' native coins reflects the quality of this work, distancing them from the notion
                            of independent currency. In the Web3 space, many consider such an organization necessary to
                            innovate, and it’s hard to disagree. However, efficiency at the expense of decentralization
                            goes against the cypherpunk ethos. This further increases the divide between Bitcoin and
                            crypto. Web3 is buzzing with activity. Yet, according to DappRadar, the top 15 blockchains
                            collectively register only 165 million unique active wallets per month. The future of the
                            space will likely hinge on finding the right balance between decentralization and
                            innovation. It will also depend on the teams’ ability to pass on their projects to the
                            community when the time comes. Blockchain-Based Tokens Beyond native coins like bitcoin and
                            ether, blockchains host a wide array of tokens, each with different functions and levels of
                            decentralization. These tokens include stablecoins, memecoins, protocol tokens, and all
                            sorts of digital units that anyone can easily create using a smart contract. The tokens
                            share the blockchain environment with native coins, but their value depends on the project
                            that issued them. For years, the tokens fueled bitcoin maximalists’ disdain for all crypto
                            but bitcoin. Numerous crypto scams, mostly involving such tokens, have caused significant
                            reputational damage to the crypto space. They have even tarnished bitcoin in the process.
                            With the introduction of Ordinals and Runes, some bitcoiners have reconsidered their stance
                            on tokens. These protocols, which assign value to satoshis (bitcoin’s smallest units) or
                            create tokens on Bitcoin, have sparked discussions about new use cases for the blockchain.
                            However, following the initial hype, both protocols now see only modest usage. Since their
                            peak in 2023, daily Ordinals inscriptions have dropped from over 400,000 to around 40,000.
                            Runes etchings have fallen from over 35,000 in April to fewer than 400. So far, bitcoin's
                            role as a better form of money is its main use, overshadowing any other. In short, bitcoin
                            remains unmatched in its decentralization and primary role as an alternative form of money.
                            Meanwhile, the broader crypto space is willing to compromise decentralization for innovation
                            and new use cases. As a result, bitcoin and crypto are growing increasingly distinct. Follow

                    BBVA plans Visa-backed stablecoin launch in 2025
                </h3>
                <div class="content-a">
                    <div class="l-content">
                        <p class="t-txt article-text">
                            BBVA has not yet decided whether the stablecoin will be backed by deposits, money market
                            funds, or fiat currencies such as the euro or U.S. dollar, said Maroto, who added the
                            company plans for it to be used for the settlement layer on exchanges. BBVA has been working
                            in the digital asset space since 2014, and Maroto hopes that the latest project will let the
                            bank benefit from the growing trend of the tokenization of assets such as real estate and
                            private credit funds. “We realized that blockchain could transform the way we exchange value
                            digitally, and consequently affect the way the financial system works,” Maroto said.
                            Stablecoin wars Stablecoins constitute a broad category in the crypto space, describing any
                            asset intended to maintain a specific price and backed by reserves such as fiat currencies,
                            commodities, or even other cryptocurrencies. While the sector has existed for a decade,
                            dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDC and Tether have exploded in popularity over the past
                            few years, with their backing companies earning hefty profits through the yields on the
                            underlying assets, which typically include U.S. Treasuries and other dollar equivalents.
                            Competitors from the traditional finance space have recently entered the race, including
                            PayPal, which launched its PYUSD stablecoin in August 2023, as well as a bevy of overseas
                            offerings that provide yield to their customers—an option restricted in the U.S. due to
                            regulatory uncertainty. Last week, Visa announced a new product that would allow financial
                            institutions such as banks to launch their own stablecoins, which Visa is calling
                            fiat-backed tokens. While the use cases would vary, the idea would be for banks to choose
                            the type of asset held as the reserve, which could vary from fiat currencies to deposits.
                            While the tokens would initially work only within the bank’s own ecosystem, Visa head of
                            crypto Cuy Sheffield told Fortune in April that the long-term plan would be to facilitate
                            interoperability between different institutions, which is an advantage of more universal
                            stablecoins such as USDC that can work across blockchains. Maroto said that BBVA wanted to
                            work with Visa, rather than choosing an existing stablecoin option, because of Visa’s
                            established brand and regulatory compliance. As one of the first financial institutions to
                            experiment with the new product, BBVA also has the edge of operating mainly in Europe, which
                            recently enacted stablecoin oversight. Maroto said that BBVA will likely build its
                            stablecoin around the euro, given its European presence, and that it could be used for
                            settlement on exchanges that offer tokenized assets, with BBVA handling the mint and burn
                            mechanism that converts fiat into crypto ecosystems. Despite the goal of launching live
                            testing next year, Maroto said that the U.S. is not on its short-term time horizon. BBVA
                            currently offers the custody and trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC in Switzerland for
                            private banking and institutional customers and is launching in Turkey.

                            Financial contracts called crypto futures let traders gamble on the future value of a
                            cryptocurrency, say Bitcoin or Ethereum. Futures trading is not spot trading, in which you
                            purchase and sell the actual commodity. It is rather anticipating whether the price of a
                            cryptocurrency will climb or decline. Traders merely trade depending on price swings, they
                            do not own the underlying item. Long (buy) and short (sell) positions are made possible by
                            this, therefore enabling traders to profit from both rising and declining markets. Futures
                            trading is special in that it lets you use leverage, hence enabling you to hold a bigger
                            position with a smaller starting-out investment. But as losses can be magnified in the same
                            manner, this also raises the danger. Important Terminology in Futures Trading in
                            Cryptocurrencies Familiarize oneself with certain fundamental phrases before delving into
                            futures trading: - Leverage lets you trade a bigger position than your real capital would
                            let, so raising either possible gains or losses. - Margin: Usually stated as a percentage of
                            the total trade value, the margin is the amount of money required to open a futures
                            contract. - Long Position: Assuming future increases in the value of a bitcoin. - Short
                            Position: Assuming the future price of a bitcoin will be lower. - Liquidation: Should the
                            market turn against you and your losses beyond your margin, the exchange may liquidate your
                            position to pay for those losses. Any novice should understand these words since they form
                            the basis of future trading techniques. Starting With Crypto Futures Trading You will first
                            need to pick a reliable exchange that provides futures contracts before starting. You can
                            try trading crypto futures on PrimeXBT, for example. The following outlines how to begin
                            going: Select a Futures Exchange When choosing a crypto futures exchange take into account
                            elements including costs, leverage choices, security measures, and trading range of
                            cryptocurrencies. Although some exchanges give up to 100x leverage, which might be alluring
                            but also quite dangerous for newbies. Open and Fund Your Account You will have to open an
                            account and make deposits following the choice of your favorite exchange. Most exchanges let
                            you make deposits in stablecoins like USDT or big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Some others
                            might also embrace fiat money. Discover the Trade Interface Learn the trading interface once
                            your account is set up. This will comprise order forms, price charts, and leverage levels.
                            If the exchange provides a demo account, it's a good idea to practice using one so you may
                            trade without running actual danger. Decide Your Leverage Starting low leverage, such 2x or
                            3x, as a novice helps you to lower your risk. Particularly in the erratic crypto market,
                            high leverage can cause major losses even as it can yield fast profits. Risk Control in
                            Futures Trading Trading crypto futures is naturally dangerous, hence long-term success
                            depends on careful risk management. Following these guidelines will help you to properly
                            manage risks: - Create stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order stops more losses by
                            automatically closing your position at a designated level. - Moderate Your Leverage: High
                            leverage raises the danger of liquidation even while it can boost earnings. Until they have
                            more experience, beginners should keep to minimal leverage. - Never trade with more than
                            your means to lose. Investing money only when you are ready to lose is crucial as the crypto
                            market is somewhat erratic. Effective futures trading mostly depends on risk management,
                            particularly in a market as erratic as cryptocurrencies. Investigating the Market Effective
                            trading futures depends on a strong foundation in market analysis. Technical analysis and
                            fundamental analysis are two basic forms of study applied in futures trading. Technical
                            Review Examining price charts, trends, and technical indicators helps one to project future
                            price changes in technical analysis. Common uses in crypto futures trading are indicators
                            including the Moving Average (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands. Basic
                            Analysis More general elements influencing bitcoin prices—such as regulatory news, technical
                            advancements, or market demand—are examined via fundamental analysis. Maintaining knowledge
                            of significant events in the cryptocurrency space helps one to better forecast market swings
                            and guide trading decisions. Typical Mistakes to Avoid Crypto futures trading can have a
                            sharp learning curve for beginners, hence mistakes are unavoidable. Still, knowledge of
                            frequent mistakes will help you reduce losses. Among typical errors are: - Leverage too much
                            and you run the danger of liquidation. Stay with low leverage, particularly in the beginning
                            stages. - Emotional trading—making snap decisions motivated by greed or fear—may result in
                            bad trades. Stay to your trading plan and try to avoid emotional responses. - Ignoring Risk
                            Control: Ignorance of stop-loss orders or lack of a risk management plan could result in
                            large losses. Avoiding these errors can help you to trade more boldly and raise your chances
                            of success. Keeping Track of Your Transactions Regular review of their transactions and
                            strategy modification depending on performance help successful futures traders. Over time,
                            keeping a trading diary in which you record the specifics of every trade—including entry and
                            exit points, trade justification, and outcome—can allow you to hone your abilities.
                            Essential also is keeping an eye on your open positions and modifying your stop-loss orders
                            when the market moves. This helps you maximize gains or reduce losses should the market go
                            erratic.

                            ZUG, SWITZERLAND, October 3, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- At CV Summit, the inaugural Swiss
                            Blockchain Awards recognised co-founders of Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin, Mihai
                            Alisie, Gavid Wood, Charles Hoskinson and Anthony Di Iorio with a Lifetime Achievement
                            Award. This event marked 10 years of Ethereumâs global contributions and for igniting a
                            flourishing, world leading blockchain ecosystem, celebrated by Swiss authorities, the
                            Canton, and the City of Zug. In her address, Karin Keller-Sutter, Vice President of the
                            Federal Council and Finance Minister, shared a powerful message, welcoming founders to
                            Switzerland, she said: "You are in the right place at the right time. Blockchain technology
                            is at a critical juncture, and so is the ecosystem here. Will blockchain be the core
                            infrastructure of the future financial system, and will Switzerland be at the heart of it?"
                            She emphasised Switzerlandâs role in fostering innovation, adding, "As finance minister,
                            I'm not only the guardian of the treasury, but also responsible for a stable, sound, and
                            innovative financial market. In blockchain technology, we see a new technology that has
                            immense potential to change how financial services are delivered and by whom." Keller-Sutter
                            praised Switzerlandâs approach to regulation: "Switzerland has always followed this
                            approach: create excellent framework conditions, treat technologies equallyâsame risks,
                            same rulesâand adapt regulations quickly where necessary to enable innovation and address
                            risks." She concluded by inspiring the blockchain community to continue driving progress:
                            "Above all, it is up to you to fill in the frame, to create, test, succeed, or fail and try
                            again." Mathias Ruch, CEO and Founder of CV VC, host of CV Summit, concluded âOver two
                            days, each year for the past decade 1000 global and Swiss Web3 industry players, gather here
                            at CV Summit to set the agenda, test out mindset and plan for driving innovation forward. It
                            is an honour for us to celebrate Ethereumâs co-founders for their visionary work and the
                            pivotal role they play in building a technology ecosystem with global impact, from the heart
                            of Crypto Valley. The foundersâ contributions have set the foundation for a flourishing
                            sector that continues to position Switzerland as a world leader in blockchain innovation.â
                            The event was attended by former Swiss presidents, Ueli Maurer and Joahann Schneider Amman,
                            Andre Wicki - Mayor, City of Zug and Heinz TÃ¤nnler - Finance Director of the Canton Zug and
                            President Swiss Blockchain Federation. Karin Keller-Sutter, Vice President of the Federal
                            Council and Finance Minister, "You are in the right place at the right time.â Vitalik
                            Buterein, Co - Founder of Ethereum - âThank you very much for the kind award. I really
                            appreciate everything that you guys have done in Zug, to create this environment that has
                            made it possible for Ethereum to be born and to grow.â Gavin Wood, Co - Founder of
                            Ethereum - âIt's gratifying to see projects which are really trying to push the boundaries
                            in this sort of socio technological political space, thank you very much for your continuing
                            support.â Charles Hoskinson, Co - Founder of Ethereum - "Thank you to Switzerland for

                            for bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from
                            Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1. "Federal debt explodes on
                            1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but
                            it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion—that's over
                            $275 billion in the red for just one day," EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative
                            Heritage Foundation, posted. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing
                            president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El
                            Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. debt
                            interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by
                            the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal
                            Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge
                            Covid-era spending and money-printing. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years,
                            crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown
                            stimulus measures. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is
                            about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price
                            surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. Last month, the Fed kicked off its
                            interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point
                            reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November—described as "crazy"

                            The cryptocurrency landscape continues to change, and amid this development, Ethereum (ETH)
                            remains one of the dominant platforms with significant growth prospects. Owing to the recent
                            ETH price changes and its great community support, many investors are predicting its
                            developments and state the price will reach $4000 by the year 2025.The hype isn’t only about
                            Ethereum staying one step ahead of its competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS) is catching the
                            attention of ETH whales. This paper seeks to explain why Rexas is getting increasing
                            interest, especially when it has not grown over the $0.10 range, and how it considers itself
                            a worthy investment with Ethereum. Ethereum’s growth trajectory Several factors affect the
                            ongoing price development of Ethereum such as the growing disenchanted financial (DeFi)
                            niches and theizing Ethereum 2.0. The more projects that carry out their activities on the
                            Ethereum blockchain, so is the demand for ETH which is likely to lift the price to the
                            projected $4,000 level. The rise of Rexas Finance (RXS) Despite Ethereum’s advantages,
                            investors are now looking for more juicy ventures that require a start-up cost that is not
                            high. Currently trading at less than $0.10, Rexas Finance (RXS) is seeking to venture into a
                            relatively new aspect of DeFI which is real estate tokenization.This unique method enables
                            investors to participate in real estate investment without incurring the cost that is
                            usually associated with assets like these. Therefore, ETH whales are grabbing the limelight
                            by expanding their investment in Rexas besides holding Ethereum. Investment potential of
                            Rexas Finance It is not only the technological innovation that differentiates Rexas Finance
                            (RXS), the prospects for growth are equally appealing. Investors see an opportunity to buy
                            an attractive asset at a presale price which is currently at $0.05 against the expected

                            astonishing spike of 2,500% within a time frame of six months. The prospect of such large

                            supporting Rexas Finance (RXS) is growing tremendously and people talk about it on social
                            and crypto platforms and forums showing its potential. ETH whales do not only look for gains

                            heavily dominated through tokenization, and the property investment sectors are bound to
                            shift. This is quite a revolutionary trend that coincides well with the the-based ideology

                            Diversification strategies for investors With Ethereum inching closer to the $4,000 mark,
                            its players are fully aware of the changing nature of cryptocurrencies. They have come to
                            the understanding that investing in assets from different sources will reduce their risks
                            and improve their returns. Hence, by including Rexas in their holdings, ETH whales are in a
                            position to maximize the growth of both Ethereum and the new real estate tokenization
                            market. The upcoming bull run and market dynamics Additionally, with a predicted listing
                            price of $0.20, it is worth buying Rexas before the October 2024 bull run. As ETH whales are

                            leading to explosive growth thereby strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency space.
                            Conclusion It seems that not only are the predictions of ETH reaching $4000 promising but
                            Rexas Finance (RXS) also poses a good investment opportunity below 0.10. The increase of
                            interest from the ETH whales is likely to shift some focus towards emerging cryptocurrencies
                            with significant returns.In shaping the future of money, both Ethereum and Rexas Finance
                            (RXS) will attract the attention of investors. The investors need to turn their heads, as

                    Nigeria’s FX crisis fuels crypto usage as transactions hit $59bn

                            Cryptocurrency usage continues to rise in Nigeria, driven by a weakening currency and
                            soaring inflation, according to a report by New York-based blockchain research firm
                            Chainalysis. The report, released Wednesday, revealed that Africa’s most populous country
                            ranked second on the firm’s Global Adoption Index and received approximately $59 billion in
                            cryptocurrency value between July 2023 and June 2024, a 4.06 per cent increase from the
                            $56.7 billion recorded during the same period of 2023. Like many African nations, Nigeria
                            faces a foreign exchange crisis, spurring crypto adoption. “About 70 percent of African
                            countries are facing an FX shortage, and businesses are struggling to get access to the
                            dollars they need to operate,” Chris Maurice, CEO and Co-Founder of Yellow Card said. The
                            report highlighted that with banks running out of dollars, many Nigerians are turning to
                            stablecoins. “The banks don’t have dollars, the government doesn’t have dollars, and even if
                            they did, they wouldn’t give them to you,” Maurice added. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, crypto
                            transactions totalled $125 billion during the same period. Chainalysis pointed out that
                            Africans are using cryptocurrency for business payments, as a hedge against inflation, and
                            for frequent, smaller retail-sized transfers. In Nigeria, crypto activity is largely driven
                            by smaller, retail, and professional-sized transactions, with around 85 per cent of the
                            value of transfers under $1 million. Moyo Sodipo, chief operating officer and co-founder of
                            Busha noted, “People are starting to see the real-world utility of cryptocurrency,
                            especially in day-to-day transactions, which is a shift from the earlier view of crypto as
                            just a get-rich-quick scheme.” Stablecoins are a major part of Nigeria’s crypto economy,
                            accounting for approximately 40 per cent of all stablecoin inflows in the region. Nigerians
                            are increasingly relying on stablecoins to send money across borders due to the
                            inefficiencies and high costs associated with traditional remittance channels. “Cross-border
                            remittances are a major use case for stablecoins in Nigeria,” Sodipo noted. “It’s much
                            faster and more affordable.” This surge in cryptocurrency activity comes despite the
                            Nigerian government’s crackdown on crypto transactions in 2024, even after the Central Bank
                            of Nigeria (CBN) lifted restrictions on digital currency usage in 2023. Using Binance as a
                            scapegoat, the country asked telecommunication firms to restrict access to crypto platforms
                            and directed operators to delist naira transactions. The government accused these platforms
                            of encouraging the manipulation of the naira to dollar rates and aiding illicit flows.
                            Despite these, crypto adoption has refused to wane, with peer-to-peer transactions playing a
                            role in sustaining its growth. However, the government’s stance on cryptocurrency appears to
                            be evolving because of the industry’s continued growth. Zacch Adedeji, chairman of the
                            Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), recently said, “We cannot run away from the
                            cryptocurrency ecosystem because it is the in-thing. But as it stands in Nigeria today,
                            there is no law that regulates cryptocurrency operations. We need a law that regulates that
                            area of our economy.” In a positive step towards regulatory clarity, the Securities Exchange
                            Commission has also begun approving principles for crypto operators. “The industry is
                            bullish on Accelerated Regulation Incubation Program (one of SEC’s regulatory frameworks);
                            it’s a shift away from uncertainty and a positive move towards regulatory clarity,” added
                            Sodipo of Busha.

                            South Korea-based crypto data aggregator YouthMeta is seeking a bigger footing in Japan, a
                            country which has been showing a stronger interest in the investment tool recently,
                            according to the company. YouthMeta provides a cryptocurrency price prediction service
                            through its Goya Premium Chart, suggesting the best time to buy and sell more than 200
                            crypto assets listed on Binance. With the company having over 30,000 users across 27
                            countries, Japan stands out as a particularly vibrant market with surging interest in
                            cryptocurrency, it explained. In March, the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, the
                            world's largest pension fund by assets under management, said it is exploring the potential
                            of bitcoin as part of its investment portfolio. “The growth (of interest in bitcoin) in
                            Japan is substantial. Seminars are consistently full of enthusiastic participants. Many have
                            formed small groups to communicate and share strategies, fostering a community that
                            motivates each other,” an official from YouthMeta's Japanese unit said. After a
                            well-received debut in the Japanese market, YouthMeta further plans to strengthen its
                            presence in other countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, which are rapidly embracing
                            cryptocurrency, according to the company. Furthermore, YouthMeta has recently updated

                            comments In July, I had my phone snatched while waiting for a taxi in central London at
                            around 1am. A man on foot grabbed it and sprinted off. The phone was unlocked when he took
                            it, because I was tracking the taxi. Once I got home, I was able to lock the phone remotely
                            at 2:17am using the 'find my iPhone' app on my wife's phone. When I logged into my emails on
                            my iPad, I saw that the thief had got into my Binance cryptocurrency account and transferred
                            out 5.16 ethereum at 1:43am. This was worth approximately $15,000 or £11,300. Snatched: Our
                            reader had his mobile phone stolen while waiting for a taxi in London I don't understand how
                            anyone was able to get into it. My phone and Binance app were both protected by a password
                            and Face ID, and the Binance account required me to use Google Authenticator for
                            verification, as well as entering a passkey I set to transfer anything out of the app. I've
                            complained to Binance, but it says it can't recover my money and therefore won't reimburse.

                            have been a victim. Binance is a cryptocurrency trading platform, where investors can buy
                            and sell coins or tokens and track the value of their holdings. The ethereum coins stolen
                            from you were transferred out of your Binance 'wallet' to an account held by the thief on a
                            different trading platform. The thieves also stole £13,000 from your bank account with
                            Revolut. However, that money was returned to you. It has left you wondering why one
                            financial institution would agree to reimburse you, and another would not. You are also
                            concerned about how the thieves got into your Binance account, which you thought was a
                            digital Fort Knox. CRANE ON THE CASE Our weekly column sees This is Money consumer expert
                            Helen Crane tackle reader problems and shine the light on companies doing both good and bad.
                            Want her to investigate a problem, or do you want to praise a firm for going that extra
                            mile? Get in touch: helen.crane@thisismoney.co.uk When you first got in touch with Binance,
                            it said that there was nothing it could do because, while you had reported the theft to
                            police, a named officer had not been assigned to the case. However, an officer from the City
                            of London police was later assigned - and still, Binance did nothing. You were ultimately
                            told that, once crypto leaves the Binance platform, there is nothing Binance can do to
                            recover it. That is true, but in many cases where scam or theft victims get their money back
                            from a bank - or another financial service like Binance - the cash itself is never actually
                            recovered. Banks often decide to pay back the victim anyway, unless they have been negligent
                            by for example giving away their Pin number. And other cryptocurrency platforms have avenues
                            to get reimbursed too, including Coinbase's account guarantee pilot which I covered in a
                            previous column and which provides one-off protection of up to £150,000 for its customers.
                            The issue with all of this is that none of it is enshrined in law. If your money is stolen,
                            it is still ultimately up to the bank or platform to decide whether you'll get it back. Big
                            changes are coming next week - but only for banks, and only for certain types of theft. The
                            Payment Systems Regulator has new rules which force banks to refund customers up to £85,000
                            if they fall for an authorised push payment (APP) scam, which is where they are tricked in
                            to transferring money to a criminal. Into the ether: The cryptocurrency - worth more than
                            £11,000 - was transferred out of N.C's Binance 'wallet' to an account held by the thief on a
                            different trading platform As your money was held in an investment account, and this was not
                            an APP scam, the new rules don't apply. Nonetheless, I got in touch with Binance to ask
                            whether it would reconsider. Unfortunately, it decided to stand firm. It told me that it
                            will only reimburse customers in cases where Binance itself is found to be at fault for the
                            loss. A spokesman said: 'If Binance is notified about a stolen device, we take immediate
                            steps to protect the associated account and restrict further activity until it is secured.
                            'Unfortunately, it appears that the attacker acted quickly on this occasion and before our
                            user was able to contact us.' In better news, it did tell me that it had gathered some
                            information about the transaction which could potentially help identify the person that took
                            your phone, and that it is willing to share this with police. Binance also addressed your
                            question about how the thief had managed to access your account, despite you having Face ID
                            and two-factor authentication activated, and setting a passkey for Binance. It confirmed
                            that the thief entered your passkey when the Ethereum was transferred. The spokesman said:
                            'The attacker may have been able to pass security if they had obtained the passcode, were
                            able to guess the passcode on the device, or had observed the victim entering the passcode
                            prior to stealing the phone.' You admitted that your phone passcode was the same as your
                            Binance passkey, but you think it is unlikely the thief saw you enter it when they stole the
                            phone, as it all happened so fast. Another possibility is that the thief saw the passcode
                            earlier in the evening. I have heard reports of thieves hanging around bars and waiting
                            until they see someone open their phone, for example to buy a drink, and then noting down
                            the passcode and targeting them for the phone later. Refusal: The crypto platform said it
                            will only reimburse fraud victims in cases where Binance itself is found to be at fault for
                            the loss It is something This is Money columnist Dave Fishwick observed, when he spent time
                            with the City of London police chasing down the mobile-stealing criminals. It is a good idea
                            not to have the same password for your phone, as well as your money apps - as this leaves
                            you exposed. As for Face ID, Apple allows users to use the passcode for the phone as a 'fall
                            back' option when the face isn't recognised - in most circumstances. Users can stop this
                            happening by opting in to a new feature called stolen device protection, which Apple
                            introduced in March. I would really recommend that every iPhone user activates this - it can
                            be found under 'Settings' and then 'Face ID and passcode'. Read More Bank of Dave on what
                            you MUST do to keep your phone safe - as he goes 'catching baddies' with London police It
                            means that when the phone is in an unfamiliar location (not the owner's home or work) their
                            credit cards can only be accessed using Face ID or Touch ID, and the user won't be able to
                            enter a password as a 'fall back' option. An hour delay is also placed on certain actions
                            such as changing the phone's password, to give them time to report it as stolen. Binance
                            said: 'As this is a device security failure, which is not the fault of Binance, we are
                            unfortunately not able to offer reimbursement.' It also recommended that users enable a
                            feature called 'IP and wallet address whitelisting'. This allows them to set a list of
                            accounts which their crypto can be sent to - and if there is an attempt to send it
                            elsewhere, it won't work. I do think it is a little disappointing that you are being
                            penalised for Apple's security shortcomings. While Binance is entitled to make its own rules
                            on reimbursements, it has been less generous than most banks - and even some other crypto
                            platforms - would be in the same circumstances. You told me you continue to work with the
                            police to find the culprit, which is admirable. Catching those responsible is the best way
                            to cut the number of phones being nicked. But there are also things we can do to protect
                            ourselves - and I hope others can learn from your experience. If you haven't yet beefed up
                            the security on your bank accounts and crypto wallets, this is your signal to do so. CRANE

                            comments In July, I had my phone snatched while waiting for a taxi in central London at
                            around 1am. A man on foot grabbed it and sprinted off. The phone was unlocked when he took
                            it, because I was tracking the taxi. Once I got home, I was able to lock the phone remotely
                            at 2:17am using the 'find my iPhone' app on my wife's phone. When I logged into my emails on
                            my iPad, I saw that the thief had got into my Binance cryptocurrency account and transferred
                            out 5.16 ethereum at 1:43am. This was worth approximately $15,000 or £11,300. Snatched: Our
                            reader had his mobile phone stolen while waiting for a taxi in London I don't understand how
                            anyone was able to get into it. My phone and Binance app were both protected by a password
                            and Face ID, and the Binance account required me to use Google Authenticator for
                            verification, as well as entering a passkey I set to transfer anything out of the app. I've
                            complained to Binance, but it says it can't recover my money and therefore won't reimburse.

                            have been a victim. Binance is a cryptocurrency trading platform, where investors can buy
                            and sell coins or tokens and track the value of their holdings. The ethereum coins stolen
                            from you were transferred out of your Binance 'wallet' to an account held by the thief on a
                            different trading platform. The thieves also stole £13,000 from your bank account with
                            Revolut. However, that money was returned to you. It has left you wondering why one
                            financial institution would agree to reimburse you, and another would not. You are also
                            concerned about how the thieves got into your Binance account, which you thought was a
                            digital Fort Knox. CRANE ON THE CASE Our weekly column sees This is Money consumer expert
                            Helen Crane tackle reader problems and shine the light on companies doing both good and bad.
                            Want her to investigate a problem, or do you want to praise a firm for going that extra
                            mile? Get in touch: helen.crane@thisismoney.co.uk When you first got in touch with Binance,
                            it said that there was nothing it could do because, while you had reported the theft to
                            police, a named officer had not been assigned to the case. However, an officer from the City
                            of London police was later assigned - and still, Binance did nothing. You were ultimately
                            told that, once crypto leaves the Binance platform, there is nothing Binance can do to
                            recover it. That is true, but in many cases where scam or theft victims get their money back
                            from a bank - or another financial service like Binance - the cash itself is never actually
                            recovered. Banks often decide to pay back the victim anyway, unless they have been negligent
                            by for example giving away their Pin number. And other cryptocurrency platforms have avenues
                            to get reimbursed too, including Coinbase's account guarantee pilot which I covered in a
                            previous column and which provides one-off protection of up to £150,000 for its customers.
                            The issue with all of this is that none of it is enshrined in law. If your money is stolen,
                            it is still ultimately up to the bank or platform to decide whether you'll get it back. Big
                            changes are coming next week - but only for banks, and only for certain types of theft. The
                            Payment Systems Regulator has new rules which force banks to refund customers up to £85,000
                            if they fall for an authorised push payment (APP) scam, which is where they are tricked in
                            to transferring money to a criminal. Into the ether: The cryptocurrency - worth more than
                            £11,000 - was transferred out of N.C's Binance 'wallet' to an account held by the thief on a
                            different trading platform As your money was held in an investment account, and this was not
                            an APP scam, the new rules don't apply. Nonetheless, I got in touch with Binance to ask
                            whether it would reconsider. Unfortunately, it decided to stand firm. It told me that it
                            will only reimburse customers in cases where Binance itself is found to be at fault for the
                            loss. A spokesman said: 'If Binance is notified about a stolen device, we take immediate
                            steps to protect the associated account and restrict further activity until it is secured.
                            'Unfortunately, it appears that the attacker acted quickly on this occasion and before our
                            user was able to contact us.' In better news, it did tell me that it had gathered some
                            information about the transaction which could potentially help identify the person that took
                            your phone, and that it is willing to share this with police. Binance also addressed your
                            question about how the thief had managed to access your account, despite you having Face ID
                            and two-factor authentication activated, and setting a passkey for Binance. It confirmed
                            that the thief entered your passkey when the Ethereum was transferred. The spokesman said:
                            'The attacker may have been able to pass security if they had obtained the passcode, were
                            able to guess the passcode on the device, or had observed the victim entering the passcode
                            prior to stealing the phone.' You admitted that your phone passcode was the same as your
                            Binance passkey, but you think it is unlikely the thief saw you enter it when they stole the
                            phone, as it all happened so fast. Another possibility is that the thief saw the passcode
                            earlier in the evening. I have heard reports of thieves hanging around bars and waiting
                            until they see someone open their phone, for example to buy a drink, and then noting down
                            the passcode and targeting them for the phone later. Refusal: The crypto platform said it
                            will only reimburse fraud victims in cases where Binance itself is found to be at fault for
                            the loss It is something This is Money columnist Dave Fishwick observed, when he spent time
                            with the City of London police chasing down the mobile-stealing criminals. It is a good idea
                            not to have the same password for your phone, as well as your money apps - as this leaves
                            you exposed. As for Face ID, Apple allows users to use the passcode for the phone as a 'fall
                            back' option when the face isn't recognised - in most circumstances. Users can stop this
                            happening by opting in to a new feature called stolen device protection, which Apple
                            introduced in March. I would really recommend that every iPhone user activates this - it can
                            be found under 'Settings' and then 'Face ID and passcode'. Read More Bank of Dave on what
                            you MUST do to keep your phone safe - as he goes 'catching baddies' with London police It
                            means that when the phone is in an unfamiliar location (not the owner's home or work) their
                            credit cards can only be accessed using Face ID or Touch ID, and the user won't be able to
                            enter a password as a 'fall back' option. An hour delay is also placed on certain actions
                            such as changing the phone's password, to give them time to report it as stolen. Binance
                            said: 'As this is a device security failure, which is not the fault of Binance, we are
                            unfortunately not able to offer reimbursement.' It also recommended that users enable a
                            feature called 'IP and wallet address whitelisting'. This allows them to set a list of
                            accounts which their crypto can be sent to - and if there is an attempt to send it
                            elsewhere, it won't work. I do think it is a little disappointing that you are being
                            penalised for Apple's security shortcomings. While Binance is entitled to make its own rules
                            on reimbursements, it has been less generous than most banks - and even some other crypto
                            platforms - would be in the same circumstances. You told me you continue to work with the
                            police to find the culprit, which is admirable. Catching those responsible is the best way
                            to cut the number of phones being nicked. But there are also things we can do to protect
                            ourselves - and I hope others can learn from your experience. If you haven't yet beefed up
                            the security on your bank accounts and crypto wallets, this is your signal to do so. CRANE

                            Police in Maharashtra have booked 19 members of the same family for allegedly duping two
                            siblings of over Rs 1 crore in a cryptocurrency scam. The incident occurred in Thane
                            district, where a man and his brother were lured into the scheme with promises of multi-fold
                            returns on their investments.After realising they had been scammed, the 42-year-old victim
                            lodged a complaint at Rabodi police station on Wednesday. The total value of the siblings'
                            combined investment was Rs 1.17 crore.Accused promised 12 times return on investmentThe
                            police have booked individuals identified as Sabir Yakub Ghachi (50), Shakir Yakub Ghachi
                            (45), Ruhiha Shakir Ghachi (39), and several other family members. They are accused of
                            convincing the victims to invest in the scheme by promising them returns of up to 12
                            times.In hopes of securing large gains, the siblings invested Rs 91.53 lakh and Rs 25.69
                            lakh starting in March 2022. However, the scam came to light after the accused failed to
                            return the investments. According to the complaint, the victims received evasive responses
                            and were issued threats. The accused also intimidated them by claiming they had connections
                            with influential individuals.The victim then approached the police, an official said.A case
                            has been registered under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) and the
